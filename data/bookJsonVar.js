All needless matters have been eliminated, so that a history almost at variance with the possibilities of later-day belief may stand forth as simple fact.

Bistritz.\u2014Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.\r\n\r\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called \u201cpaprika hendl,\u201d and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don\u2019t know how I should be able to get on without it.\r\n\r\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.\r\n\r\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)\r\n\r\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was \u201cmamaliga,\u201d and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call \u201cimpletata.\u201d (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\r\n\r\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.\r\n\r\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier\u2014for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina\u2014it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.\r\n\r\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress\u2014white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, \u201cThe Herr Englishman?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cJonathan Harker.\u201d She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Friend.\u2014Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour friend,\r\n\u201cDracula.\u201d\r\n\r\n4 May.\u2014I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.\r\n\r\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMust you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?\u201d She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know what day it is?\u201d I answered that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said again:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?\u201d On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the eve of St. George\u2019s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?\u201d She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, \u201cFor your mother\u2019s sake,\u201d and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady\u2019s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5 May. The Castle.\u2014The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called \u201crobber steak\u201d\u2014bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat\u2019s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhen I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door\u2014which they call by a name meaning \u201cword-bearer\u201d\u2014came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were \u201cOrdog\u201d\u2014Satan, \u201cpokol\u201d\u2014hell, \u201cstregoica\u201d\u2014witch, \u201cvrolok\u201d and \u201cvlkoslak\u201d\u2014both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (Mem., I must ask the Count about these superstitions)\r\n\r\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat\u2014\u201cgotza\u201d they call them\u2014cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.\r\n\r\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom\u2014apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the \u201cMittel Land\u201d ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\r\n\r\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLook! Isten szek!\u201d\u2014\u201cGod\u2019s seat!\u201d\u2014and he crossed himself reverently.\r\n\r\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon\u2014the ordinary peasant\u2019s cart\u2014with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver\u2019s haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said; \u201cyou must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce\u201d; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry\u2014for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest\u2014\u201cand you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.\u201d The only stop he would make was a moment\u2019s pause to light his lamps.\r\n\r\nWhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz\u2014the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was \u201cAn hour less than the time.\u201d Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day.\u201d Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a cal\u00e8che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are early to-night, my friend.\u201d The man stammered in reply:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe English Herr was in a hurry,\u201d to which the stranger replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\u201d As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger\u2019s \u201cLenore\u201d:\u2014\r\n\u201cDenn die Todten reiten schnell\u201d\u2014\r\n(\u201cFor the dead travel fast.\u201d)\r\n\r\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \u201cGive me the Herr\u2019s luggage,\u201d said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the cal\u00e8che. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the cal\u00e8che was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\u201d I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\r\n\r\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road\u2014a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling\u2014that of wolves\u2014which affected both the horses and myself in the same way\u2014for I was minded to jump from the cal\u00e8che and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\r\n\r\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver\u2019s motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose\u2014it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all\u2014and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.\r\n\r\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the cal\u00e8che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the cal\u00e8che, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\u2014continued\r\n\r\n5 May.\u2014I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen the cal\u00e8che stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings.\r\n\r\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor\u2019s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor\u2019s clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor\u2014for just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning.\r\n\r\nJust as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back.\r\n\r\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWelcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\u201d He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice\u2014more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWelcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring!\u201d The strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCount Dracula?\u201d He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in; the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\u201d As he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I protested but he insisted:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not available. Let me see to your comfort myself.\u201d He insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared.\r\n\r\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,\u2014also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh\u2014which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe light and warmth and the Count\u2019s courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room.\r\n\r\nI found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\u201d\r\n\r\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me. He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all matters.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had experienced.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had finished my supper, and by my host\u2019s desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.\r\n\r\nHis face was a strong\u2014a very strong\u2014aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\r\n\r\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse\u2014broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count\u2019s eyes gleamed, and he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cListen to them\u2014the children of the night. What music they make!\u201d Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter.\u201d Then he rose and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon; so sleep well and dream well!\u201d With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\r\n\r\nI am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7 May.\u2014It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which was written:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.\u2014D.\u201d I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one. There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value. The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves. Some time after I had finished my meal\u2014I do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o\u2019clock when I had it\u2014I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Count\u2019s permission. There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\r\n\r\nIn the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books were of the most varied kind\u2014history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law\u2014all relating to England and English life and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the London Directory, the \u201cRed\u201d and \u201cBlue\u201d books, Whitaker\u2019s Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and\u2014it somehow gladdened my heart to see it\u2014the Law List.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night\u2019s rest. Then he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you. These companions\u201d\u2014and he laid his hand on some of the books\u2014\u201chave been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Count,\u201d I said, \u201cyou know and speak English thoroughly!\u201d He bowed gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said, \u201cyou speak excellently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so,\u201d he answered. \u201cWell, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not\u2014and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, \u2018Ha, ha! a stranger!\u2019 I have been so long master that I would be master still\u2014or at least that none other should be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose. He answered: \u201cYes, certainly,\u201d and added:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.\u201d I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what strange things there may be.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, if only for talking\u2019s sake, I asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year\u2014last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway\u2014a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. \u201cThat treasure has been hidden,\u201d he went on, \u201cin the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them\u2014men and women, the aged and the children too\u2014and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how,\u201d said I, \u201ccan it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\u201d The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you are right,\u201d I said. \u201cI know no more than the dead where even to look for them.\u201d Then we drifted into other matters.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d he said at last, \u201ctell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me.\u201d With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw\u2019s Guide. When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan\u2014nay, pardon me, I fall into my country\u2019s habit of putting your patronymic first\u2014my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to medi\u00e6val times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young; and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may.\u201d Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.\r\n\r\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.\r\n\r\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. \u201cAha!\u201d he said; \u201cstill at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I am informed that your supper is ready.\u201d He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host\u2019s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us,\u201d and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\r\n\r\nI went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8 May.\u2014I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with, and he!\u2014I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say at once how I stand\u2014or seem to.\r\n\r\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count\u2019s voice saying to me, \u201cGood-morning.\u201d I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count\u2019s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care,\u201d he said, \u201ctake care how you cut yourself. It is more dangerous than you think in this country.\u201d Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on: \u201cAnd this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul bauble of man\u2019s vanity. Away with it!\u201d and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\r\n\r\nWhen I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.\r\n\r\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.\r\n\r\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\u2014continued\r\n\r\nWHEN I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly\u2014as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life\u2014and began to think over what was best to be done. I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.\r\n\r\nI had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought\u2014that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMidnight.\u2014I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said \u201cwe,\u201d and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of his race:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?\u201d He held up his arms. \u201cIs it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, \u2018water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.\u2019 Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the \u2018bloody sword,\u2019 or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Moh\u00e1cs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the Szekelys\u2014and the Dracula as their heart\u2019s blood, their brains, and their swords\u2014can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (Mem., this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the \u201cArabian Nights,\u201d for everything has to break off at cockcrow\u2014or like the ghost of Hamlet\u2019s father.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12 May.\u2014Let me begin with facts\u2014bare, meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examining at Lincoln\u2019s Inn. There was a certain method in the Count\u2019s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.\r\n\r\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\u201d I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cI could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied; and \u201csuch is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?\u201d It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen write now, my young friend,\u201d he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder: \u201cwrite to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you wish me to stay so long?\u201d I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cI desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not so?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins\u2019s interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is it not so?\u201d As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could.\r\n\r\nOne of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.\u201d At the door he turned, and after a moment\u2019s pause said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me advise you, my dear young friend\u2014nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then\u201d\u2014He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed\u2014I imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.\r\n\r\nWhen he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count\u2019s own room would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw was the Count\u2019s head coming out from the window. I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me; I am in fear\u2014in awful fear\u2014and there is no escape for me; I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15 May.\u2014Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail\u2014the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count\u2019s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere \u201cmodernity\u201d cannot kill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater: the Morning of 16 May.\u2014God preserve my sanity, for to this I am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past. Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say:\u2014\r\n\u201cMy tablets! quick, my tablets!\r\n\u2019Tis meet that I put it down,\u201d etc.,\r\n\r\nfor now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose. The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.\r\n\r\nThe Count\u2019s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!\r\n\r\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count\u2019s warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real\u2014so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.\r\n\r\nI was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina\u2019s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth. They whispered together, and then they all three laughed\u2014such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on. One said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin.\u201d The other added:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.\u201d I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation. The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.\r\n\r\nI was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one\u2019s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer\u2014nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited\u2014waited with beating heart.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant\u2019s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware how you meddle with him, or you\u2019ll have to deal with me.\u201d The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou yourself never loved; you never love!\u201d On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work to be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre we to have nothing to-night?\u201d said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\r\n\r\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\u2014continued\r\n\r\nI AWOKE in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who were\u2014who are\u2014waiting to suck my blood.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n18 May.\u2014I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I must know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside. I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19 May.\u2014I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and then said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29.\u201d\r\n\r\nI know now the span of my life. God help me!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n28 May.\u2014There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law. They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar, and call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion, save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany tongue.\r\n\r\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could their spoken language....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have written the letters. Mina\u2019s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they come, I shall, of course, take care. See!\u201d\u2014he must have looked at it\u2014\u201cone is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other\u201d\u2014here he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly\u2014\u201cthe other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.\u201d And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter to Hawkins\u2014that I shall, of course, send on, since it is yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?\u201d He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.\r\n\r\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSo, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours to me; but you will sleep, I pray.\u201d I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n31 May.\u2014This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a shock!\r\n\r\nEvery scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda, relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.\r\n\r\nThe suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new scheme of villainy....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n17 June.\u2014This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses\u2019 feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard. With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a shock: my door was fastened on the outside.\r\n\r\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the \u201chetman\u201d of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away. The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse\u2019s head. Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n24 June, before morning.\u2014Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthless villainy.\r\n\r\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count\u2019s window. I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me.\r\n\r\nIt makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal\u2019s right and consolation.\r\n\r\nI thought I would watch for the Count\u2019s return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the a\u00ebrial gambolling.\r\n\r\nSomething made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.\r\n\r\nWhen a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Count\u2019s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.\r\n\r\nAs I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without\u2014the agonised cry of a woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMonster, give me my child!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.\r\n\r\nSomewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.\r\n\r\nThere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.\r\n\r\nI could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n25 June, morning.\u2014No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth.\r\n\r\nLet me not think of it. Action!\r\n\r\nIt has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room! But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.\r\n\r\nYes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man\u2019s death is not a calf\u2019s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSame day, later.\u2014I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Count\u2019s window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did not feel dizzy\u2014I suppose I was too excited\u2014and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner\u2014gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.\r\n\r\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a discovery.\r\n\r\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I could not say which\u2014for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death\u2014and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there. I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count\u2019s room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n29 June.\u2014To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man\u2019s hand would have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nI was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.\u201d I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy may I not go to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.\u201d He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness. He said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your baggage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our boyars: \u2018Welcome the coming; speed the parting guest.\u2019 Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!\u201d With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cHark!\u201d\r\n\r\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the b\u00e2ton of the conductor. After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.\r\n\r\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.\r\n\r\nAs the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count\u2019s body stood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance I cried out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cShut the door; I shall wait till morning!\u201d and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.\r\n\r\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBack, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!\u201d There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.\r\n\r\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n30 June, morning.\u2014These may be the last words I ever write in this diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready.\r\n\r\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe. With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts.\r\n\r\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the Count.\r\n\r\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count\u2019s room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count\u2019s room. It was empty, but that was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.\r\n\r\nThe great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell.\r\n\r\nI thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count\u2019s room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.\r\n\r\nAs I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.\r\n\r\nThe door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.\r\n\r\nHark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the distance.\r\n\r\nI am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!\r\n\r\nI shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.\r\n\r\nAnd then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet!\r\n\r\nAt least God\u2019s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep\u2014as a man. Good-bye, all! Mina!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLetter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra.\r\n\r\n\u201c9 May.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Lucy,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cForgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying. I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan\u2019s studies, and I have been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way. I don\u2019t mean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange countries. I wonder if we\u2014I mean Jonathan and I\u2014shall ever see them together. There is the ten o\u2019clock bell ringing. Good-bye.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour loving\r\n\u201cMina.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome, curly-haired man???\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray.\r\n\r\n\u201c17, Chatham Street,\r\n\u201cWednesday.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Mina,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I wrote to you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only your second. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one\u2019s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day. There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children; we have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn\u2019t you guess? I love him. I am blushing as I write, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don\u2019t want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cLUCY.\r\n\r\n\u201cP.S.\u2014I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.\r\n\r\n\u201cL.\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray.\r\n\r\n\u201c24 May.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Mina,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn\u2019t it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don\u2019t know what to do with myself. And three proposals! But, for goodness\u2019 sake, don\u2019t tell any of the girls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of course, Jonathan. You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything\u2014don\u2019t you think so, dear?\u2014and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don\u2019t generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman\u2019s heart was free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can\u2019t help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn\u2019t at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvening.\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don\u2019t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and yet\u2014\u2014 My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl alone. No, he doesn\u2019t, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance, and I helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn\u2019t always speak slang\u2014that is to say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners\u2014but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Miss Lucy, I know I ain\u2019t good enough to regulate the fixin\u2019s of your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won\u2019t you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together, driving in double harness?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn\u2019t seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn\u2019t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit serious too\u2014I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid flirt\u2014though I couldn\u2019t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is I\u2019ll never trouble you a hair\u2019s breadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears\u2014I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one\u2014and I really felt very badly. Why can\u2019t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris\u2019s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me.\u2019 I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine\u2014I think I put them into his\u2014and said in a hearty way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018That\u2019s my brave girl. It\u2019s better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don\u2019t cry, my dear. If it\u2019s for me, I\u2019m a hard nut to crack; and I take it standing up. If that other fellow doesn\u2019t know his happiness, well, he\u2019d better look for it soon, or he\u2019ll have to deal with me. Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that\u2019s rarer than a lover; it\u2019s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I\u2019m going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won\u2019t you give me one kiss? It\u2019ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow\u2014he must be a good fellow, my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him\u2014hasn\u2019t spoken yet.\u2019 That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival\u2014wasn\u2019t it?\u2014and he so sad; so I leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down into my face\u2014I am afraid I was blushing very much\u2014he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Little girl, I hold your hand, and you\u2019ve kissed me, and if these things don\u2019t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and good-bye.\u2019 He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free\u2014only I don\u2019t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I don\u2019t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.\r\n\r\n\u201cEver your loving\r\n\u201cLucy.\r\n\r\n\u201cP.S.\u2014Oh, about number Three\u2014I needn\u2019t tell you of number Three, need I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don\u2019t know what I have done to deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover, such a husband, and such a friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n(Kept in phonograph)\r\n\r\n25 May.\u2014Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.\r\n\r\nI questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madness\u2014a thing which I avoid with the patients as I would the mouth of hell.\r\n\r\n(Mem., under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit of hell?) Omnia Rom\u00e6 venalia sunt. Hell has its price! verb. sap. If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards accurately, so I had better commence to do so, therefore\u2014\r\n\r\nR. M. Renfield, \u00e6tat 59.\u2014Sanguine temperament; great physical strength; morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it.\r\n\r\nLetter, Quincey P. Morris to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.\r\n\r\n\u201c25 May.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Art,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one another\u2019s wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas; and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won\u2019t you let this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation in asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and that you are free. There will only be one other, our old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward. He\u2019s coming, too, and we both want to mingle our weeps over the wine-cup, and to drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man in all the wide world, who has won the noblest heart that God has made and the best worth winning. We promise you a hearty welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your own right hand. We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes.

Whitby.\u2014Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to see down. The houses of the old town\u2014the side away from us\u2014are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of \u201cMarmion,\u201d where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk.\r\n\r\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.\r\n\r\nIt is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he is coming this way....\r\n\r\nHe is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t fash masel\u2019 about them, miss. Them things be all wore out. Mind, I don\u2019t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn\u2019t in my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an\u2019 the like, but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and Leeds that be always eatin\u2019 cured herrin\u2019s an\u2019 drinkin\u2019 tea an\u2019 lookin\u2019 out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel\u2019 who\u2019d be bothered tellin\u2019 lies to them\u2014even the newspapers, which is full of fool-talk.\u201d I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn\u2019t like to be kept waitin\u2019 when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of \u2019em; an\u2019, miss, I lack belly-timber sairly by the clock.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them\u2014I do not know how many\u2014and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go. They will be home by this.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1 August.\u2014I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can\u2019t out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it and put it down:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that\u2019s what it be, an\u2019 nowt else. These bans an\u2019 wafts an\u2019 boh-ghosts an\u2019 barguests an\u2019 bogles an\u2019 all anent them is only fit to set bairns an\u2019 dizzy women a-belderin\u2019. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an\u2019 all grims an\u2019 signs an\u2019 warnin\u2019s, be all invented by parsons an\u2019 illsome beuk-bodies an\u2019 railway touters to skeer an\u2019 scunner hafflin\u2019s, an\u2019 to get folks to do somethin\u2019 that they don\u2019t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think o\u2019 them. Why, it\u2019s them that, not content with printin\u2019 lies on paper an\u2019 preachin\u2019 them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin\u2019 them on the tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them steans, holdin\u2019 up their heads as well as they can out of their pride, is acant\u2014simply tumblin\u2019 down with the weight o\u2019 the lies wrote on them, \u2018Here lies the body\u2019 or \u2018Sacred to the memory\u2019 wrote on all of them, an\u2019 yet in nigh half of them there bean\u2019t no bodies at all; an\u2019 the memories of them bean\u2019t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less sacred. Lies all of them, nothin\u2019 but lies of one kind or another! My gog, but it\u2019ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they come tumblin\u2019 up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an\u2019 tryin\u2019 to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them trimmlin\u2019 and ditherin\u2019, with their hands that dozzened an\u2019 slippy from lyin\u2019 in the sea that they can\u2019t even keep their grup o\u2019 them.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see from the old fellow\u2019s self-satisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was \u201cshowing off,\u201d so I put in a word to keep him going:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Swales, you can\u2019t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin\u2019 where they make out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now look you here; you come here a stranger, an\u2019 you see this kirk-garth.\u201d I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church. He went on: \u201cAnd you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be happed here, snod an\u2019 snog?\u201d I assented again. \u201cThen that be just where the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as old Dun\u2019s \u2019bacca-box on Friday night.\u201d He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed. \u201cAnd my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!\u201d I went over and read:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cEdward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, \u00e6t. 30.\u201d When I came back Mr. Swales went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWho brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast of Andres! an\u2019 you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above\u201d\u2014he pointed northwards\u2014\u201cor where the currents may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey\u2014I knew his father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in \u201920; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in \u201950. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they\u2019d be jommlin\u2019 an\u2019 jostlin\u2019 one another that way that it \u2019ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when we\u2019d be at one another from daylight to dark, an\u2019 tryin\u2019 to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.\u201d This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said, \u201csurely you are not quite correct, for you start on the assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think that will be really necessary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo please their relatives, I suppose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo please their relatives, you suppose!\u201d This he said with intense scorn. \u201cHow will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?\u201d He pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. \u201cRead the lies on that thruff-stean,\u201d he said. The letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over and read:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son. \u2018He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.\u2019 Really, Mr. Swales, I don\u2019t see anything very funny in that!\u201d She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.\r\n\r\n\u201cYe don\u2019t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that\u2019s because ye don\u2019t gawm the sorrowin\u2019 mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was acrewk\u2019d\u2014a regular lamiter he was\u2014an\u2019 he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn\u2019t get an insurance she put on his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin\u2019 the crows with. \u2019Twarn\u2019t for crows then, for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That\u2019s the way he fell off the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I\u2019ve often heard him say masel\u2019 that he hoped he\u2019d go to hell, for his mother was so pious that she\u2019d be sure to go to heaven, an\u2019 he didn\u2019t want to addle where she was. Now isn\u2019t that stean at any rate\u201d\u2014he hammered it with his stick as he spoke\u2014\u201ca pack of lies? and won\u2019t it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin\u2019 up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she said, rising up:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t harm ye, my pretty; an\u2019 it may make poor Geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin\u2019 on his lap. That won\u2019t hurt ye. Why, I\u2019ve sat here off an\u2019 on for nigh twenty years past, an\u2019 it hasn\u2019t done me no harm. Don\u2019t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn\u2019 lie there either! It\u2019ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field. There\u2019s the clock, an\u2019 I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!\u201d And off he hobbled.\r\n\r\nLucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven\u2019t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe same day. I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan. The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly; they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of a donkey\u2019s hoofs up the paved road below. The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street. Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he were here.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n5 June.\u2014The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed; selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: \u201cMay I have three days? I shall clear them away.\u201d Of course, I said that would do. I must watch him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n18 June.\u2014He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1 July.\u2014His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the totals added in batches again, as though he were \u201cfocussing\u201d some account, as the auditors put it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8 July.\u2014There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19 July.\u2014We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour\u2014a very, very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cA kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, and teach, and feed\u2014and feed\u2014and feed!\u201d I was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?\u201d I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know more.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10 p. m.\u2014I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it. I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n20 July.\u2014Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away. There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11 a. m.\u2014The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. \u201cMy belief is, doctor,\u201d he said, \u201cthat he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11 p. m.\u2014I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to invent a new classification for him, and call him a zo\u00f6phagous (life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect\u2014the knowledge of the brain? Had I even the secret of one such mind\u2014did I hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic\u2014I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson\u2019s physiology or Ferrier\u2019s brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?\r\n\r\nHow well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?\r\n\r\nTo me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on hopeless and work. Work! work!\r\n\r\nIf I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there\u2014a good, unselfish cause to make me work\u2014that would be indeed happiness.\r\n\r\nMina Murray\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n26 July.\u2014I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it is like whispering to one\u2019s self and listening at the same time. And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan; I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy\u2019s father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood\u2014he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming\u2014is coming up here very shortly\u2014as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he arrives.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n27 July.\u2014No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him, though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy\u2019s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely rose-pink. She has lost that an\u00e6mic look which she had. I pray it will all last.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3 August.\u2014Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room searching for the key.\r\n\r\n6 August.\u2014Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey\u2014except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock; grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a \u201cbrool\u201d over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem \u201cmen like trees walking.\u201d The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk....\r\n\r\nI have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to say something to you, miss.\u201d I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things I\u2019ve been sayin\u2019 about the dead, and such like, for weeks past; but I didn\u2019t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I\u2019m gone. We aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don\u2019t altogether like to think of it, and we don\u2019t want to feel scart of it; an\u2019 that\u2019s why I\u2019ve took to makin\u2019 light of it, so that I\u2019d cheer up my own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain\u2019t afraid of dyin\u2019, not a bit; only I don\u2019t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect; and I\u2019m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin\u2019 his scythe. Ye see, I can\u2019t get out o\u2019 the habit of caffin\u2019 about it all at once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don\u2019t ye dooal an\u2019 greet, my deary!\u201d\u2014for he saw that I was crying\u2014\u201cif he should come this very night I\u2019d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a waitin\u2019 for somethin\u2019 else than what we\u2019re doin\u2019; and death be all that we can rightly depend on. But I\u2019m content, for it\u2019s comin\u2019 to me, my deary, and comin\u2019 quick. It may be comin\u2019 while we be lookin\u2019 and wonderin\u2019. Maybe it\u2019s in that wind out over the sea that\u2019s bringin\u2019 with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!\u201d he cried suddenly. \u201cThere\u2019s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It\u2019s in the air; I feel it comin\u2019. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call comes!\u201d He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes\u2019 silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.\r\n\r\nI was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time kept looking at a strange ship.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t make her out,\u201d he said; \u201cshe\u2019s a Russian, by the look of her; but she\u2019s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn\u2019t know her mind a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can\u2019t decide whether to run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is steered mighty strangely, for she doesn\u2019t mind the hand on the wheel; changes about with every puff of wind. We\u2019ll hear more of her before this time to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCUTTING FROM \u201cTHE DAILYGRAPH,\u201d 8 AUGUST\r\n\r\n(Pasted in Mina Murray\u2019s Journal.)\r\n\r\nFrom a Correspondent.\r\n\r\nWhitby.\r\n\r\nONE greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of \u201ctripping\u201d both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of \u201cmares\u2019-tails\u201d high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked \u201cNo. 2: light breeze.\u201d The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour\u2014flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the \u201cPrelude to the Great Storm\u201d will grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his \u201ccobble\u201d or his \u201cmule,\u201d as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually \u201chug\u201d the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,\r\n\u201cAs idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\u201d\r\n\r\nShortly before ten o\u2019clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of nature\u2019s silence. A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.\r\n\r\nThen without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster. White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland\u2014white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.\r\n\r\nSome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest\u2014the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\r\n\r\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, \u201cshe must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell.\u201d Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto\u2014a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\r\n\r\nThere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the \u201ctop-hammer\u201d came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones\u2014\u201cthruff-steans\u201d or \u201cthrough-stones,\u201d as they call them in the Whitby vernacular\u2014actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd. When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor\u2014Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place\u2014who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death\u2014a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca\u2014and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.\r\n\r\nAlready the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating; crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm.\r\n\r\nWhitby\r\n\r\n9 August.\u2014The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the Demeter. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo\u2014a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a \u201cnine days\u2019 wonder,\u201d they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found; it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master\u2019s yard. It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted to look over the log-book of the Demeter, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my statement must be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.\r\n\r\nLOG OF THE \u201cDEMETER.\u201d\r\n\r\nVarna to Whitby.\r\n\r\nWritten 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth. At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates, cook, and myself (captain).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something. Seemed scared, but would not speak out.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only told him there was something, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but would not say more than there was something aboard. Mate getting very impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way, and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed. He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from stem to stern.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n22 July.\u2014Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with sails\u2014no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread. Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n24 July.\u2014There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short, and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last night another man lost\u2014disappeared. Like the first, he came off his watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do some violence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n28 July.\u2014Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours\u2019 sleep. Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is steadier.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n29 July.\u2014Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n30 July.\u2014Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine, all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1 August.\u2014Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere. Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower, as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2 August, midnight.\u2014Woke up from few minutes\u2019 sleep by hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God seems to have deserted us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3 August.\u2014At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: \u201cIt is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air.\u201d And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space. Then he went on: \u201cBut It is here, and I\u2019ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I\u2019ll unscrew them one by one and see. You work the helm.\u201d And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it\u2019s no use my trying to stop him. He can\u2019t hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as \u201cclay,\u201d and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can\u2019t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer\u2014for I heard him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him\u2014there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun\u2014a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear. \u201cSave me! save me!\u201d he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said: \u201cYou had better come too, captain, before it is too late. He is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me from Him, and it is all that is left!\u201d Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these horrors when I get to port? When I get to port! Will that ever be?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4 August.\u2014Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the night I saw It\u2014Him! God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with them I shall tie that which He\u2014It!\u2014dare not touch; and then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not, ... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOf course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce; and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave.\r\n\r\nNo trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so will end this one more \u201cmystery of the sea.\u201d\r\n\r\nMina Murray\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n8 August.\u2014Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbour\u2014like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10 August.\u2014The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cort\u00e8ge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog. The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat\u2019s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things\u2014the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror\u2014will all afford material for her dreams.\r\n\r\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood\u2019s Bay and back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMINA MURRAY\u2019S JOURNAL\r\n\r\nSame day, 11 o\u2019clock p. m.\u2014Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital \u201csevere tea\u201d at Robin Hood\u2019s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shocked the \u201cNew Woman\u201d with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don\u2019t take supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some of the \u201cNew Women\u201d writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won\u2019t condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make of it, too! There\u2019s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11 August, 3 a. m.\u2014Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write. I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.... Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy\u2019s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. \u201cThank God,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cshe cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.\u201d I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear\u2014I don\u2019t know which\u2014of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary\u2019s Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy\u2019s condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, \u201cLucy! Lucy!\u201d and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.\r\n\r\nWhen I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were parted, and she was breathing\u2014not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not. However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.\r\n\r\nFortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or \u201cwynds,\u201d as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she asked\u2014even implored\u2014me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother\u2019s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted\u2014nay, infallibly would\u2014in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSame day, noon.\u2014All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSame day, night.\u2014We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any trouble to-night.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12 August.\u2014My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can\u2019t alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n13 August.\u2014Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky\u2014merged together in one great, silent mystery\u2014was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully. She did not stir again all night.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14 August.\u2014On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHis red eyes again! They are just the same.\u201d It was such an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary\u2019s Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I called Lucy\u2019s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home\u2014it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen\u2014I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy\u2019s head leaning out. I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.\r\n\r\nI did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened.\r\n\r\nShe looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it is.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15 August.\u2014Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast. Arthur\u2019s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy\u2019s sleep-walking.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n17 August.\u2014No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness. No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her mother\u2019s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy\u2019s fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed. They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.\r\n\r\nLetter, Samuel F.

Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way an\u00e6mic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy poor little feet didn\u2019t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn\u2019t want to wake up Geordie.\u201d As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur\u2014I call him Arthur from her habit\u2014says he loves; and, indeed, I don\u2019t wonder that he does. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be here in this spot\u2014I don\u2019t know why, for I was afraid of something\u2014I don\u2019t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling\u2014the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once\u2014as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air. I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before I felt you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19 August.\u2014Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary, and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister\u2019s letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is in my heart. My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet.\r\n\r\nLetter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina Murray.\r\n\r\n\u201c12 August.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear Madam,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks, suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love, and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins, Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few weeks\u2019 rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall not be wanting for help.\r\n\r\n\u201cBelieve me,\r\n\u201cYours, with sympathy and all blessings,\r\n\u201cSister Agatha.\r\n\r\n\u201cP. S.\u2014My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock\u2014so says our doctor\u2014and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for safety\u2019s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many, many, happy years for you both.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n19 August.\u2014Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About eight o\u2019clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he would say was:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you: you don\u2019t count now; the Master is at hand.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The combination is a dreadful one. At nine o\u2019clock I visited him myself. His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!\r\n\r\nFor half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBother them all! I don\u2019t care a pin about them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me you don\u2019t care about spiders?\u201d (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride; but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time I remained with him.\r\n\r\nI am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been. If I don\u2019t sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus\u2014C2HCl3O. H2O! I must be careful not to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be, to-night shall be sleepless....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn\u2019t get through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.\r\n\r\nI ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield\u2019s figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him\u2014the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in. I heard him say:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe is a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn\u2019t get free from the strait-waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he\u2019s chained to the wall in the padded room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.\r\n\r\nJust now he spoke coherent words for the first time:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be patient, Master. It is coming\u2014coming\u2014coming!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLetter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.\r\n\r\n\u201cBuda-Pesth, 24 August.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Lucy,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about, added: \u2018I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.\u2019 I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew that no other woman was a cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps. He is waking!...\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things. I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at it\u2014for I knew then that I might find some clue to his trouble\u2014but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment. Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Wilhelmina\u2019\u2014I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him\u2014\u2018you know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.\u2019 For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete. \u2018Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.\u2019 He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u201cShe has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u201cLucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his \u2018I will\u2019 firmly and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband\u2014oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words \u2018my husband\u2019\u2014left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took his wife\u2019s hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn pledge between us....\r\n\r\n\u201cLucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am now. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan is waking\u2014I must attend to my husband!\r\n\r\n\u201cYour ever-loving\r\n\u201cMina Harker.\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhitby, 30 August.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Mina,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and I love him more than ever. He tells me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn\u2019t love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me. So no more just at present from your loving\r\n\r\n\u201cLucy.\r\n\r\n\u201cP. S.\u2014Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.\r\n\r\n\u201cP. P. S.\u2014We are to be married on 28 September.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n20 August.\u2014The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion. For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: \u201cNow I can wait; now I can wait.\u201d The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading\u2014I might almost say, \u201ccringing\u201d\u2014softness. I was satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThey think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The fools!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will only say: \u201cI don\u2019t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now, and I can wait; I can wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n... Three nights has the same thing happened\u2014violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went. Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they are required....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n23 August.\u2014\u201cThe unexpected always happens.\u201d How well Disraeli knew life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul\u2019s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark! The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow. Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught the patient\u2019s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t tie me; I shall go quietly!\u201d Without trouble we came back to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night....\r\n\r\nLucy Westenra\u2019s Diary\r\n\r\nHillingham, 24 August.\u2014I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn\u2019t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder if I could sleep in mother\u2019s room to-night. I shall make an excuse and try.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n25 August.\u2014Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don\u2019t seem ever to get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I know he will be miserable to see me so.\r\n\r\nLetter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlbemarle Hotel, 31 August.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Jack,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to disturb the poor lady\u2019s mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is spoken\u2014disease of the heart\u2014though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl\u2019s mind. I am almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at first\u2014I know why, old fellow\u2014she finally consented. It will be a painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for her sake, and I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at Hillingham to-morrow, two o\u2019clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can after you have seen her. Do not fail!\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur.\u201d\r\n\r\nTelegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward.\r\n\r\n\u201c1 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cAm summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully by to-night\u2019s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood.\r\n\r\n\u201c2 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear old fellow,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWith regard to Miss Westenra\u2019s health I hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.\r\n\r\n\u201cI found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is. We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.\u2019 I reminded her that a doctor\u2019s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word. \u2018Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for myself, but all for him!\u2019 So I am quite free.\r\n\r\n\u201cI could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see the usual an\u00e6mic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats\u2014these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind\u2014work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours always,\r\n\u201cJohn Seward.\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr. Seward.\r\n\r\n\u201c2 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy good Friend,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come. Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.\r\n\r\n\u201cVan Helsing.\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.\r\n\r\n\u201c3 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Art,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cVan Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and found that, by Lucy\u2019s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned, but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter, he said: \u2018You must tell him all you think. Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.\u2019 I asked what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for The Daily Telegraph. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make it. In any case I am to have a letter.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy\u2019s pretense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale. To them I say: \u201cPouf!\u201d \u2019 And he snapped his fingers at me and went on: \u2018But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can he\u2019\u2014and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of\u2014\u2018know anything of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.\u2019 I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but said: \u2018I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way an\u00e6mic. I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease\u2014for not to be all well is a disease\u2014interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone. And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n4 September.\u2014Zo\u00f6phagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly. I cannot quite understand it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Another change in my patient. At five o\u2019clock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAll over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do it for myself!\u201d Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said: \u201cDoctor, won\u2019t you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar? I think it would be good for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the flies?\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like it.\u201d And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMidnight.\u2014Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised me, so I asked him: \u201cAre you not going to keep flies any more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said he; \u201cI am sick of all that rubbish!\u201d He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures\u2014as at times the moon does others? We shall see.\r\n\r\nTelegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\u201c4 September.\u2014Patient still better to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nTelegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\u201c5 September.\u2014Patient greatly improved.

Come at once; do not lose an hour. I hold over telegram to Holmwood till have seen you.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLetter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.\r\n\r\n\u201c6 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Art,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit. There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy\u2019s weak condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for news. In haste\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\u201cJohn Seward.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n7 September.\u2014The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at Liverpool Street was:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight, my friend,\u201d he said, \u201cquite right! Better he not know as yet; perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God\u2019s madmen, too\u2014the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest\u2014where it may gather its kind around it and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.\u201d He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way. \u201cI have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfold to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not now?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt may do some good; we may arrive at some decision.\u201d He stopped and looked at me, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened\u2014while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: \u2018Look! he\u2019s good corn; he will make good crop when the time comes.\u2019 \u201d I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: \u201cThe good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all, there\u2019s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.\u201d He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very gravely:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be\u2014mind, I say may be\u2014of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I described Lucy\u2019s symptoms\u2014the same as before, but infinitely more marked\u2014he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, \u201cthe ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade,\u201d as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal\u2014even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached\u2014do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.\r\n\r\nI used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy\u2019s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing\u2019s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. \u201cMy God!\u201d he said; \u201cthis is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart\u2019s action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cJack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming.\u201d When first the Professor\u2019s eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.\u201d For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. \u201cYou are to help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d asked Arthur hoarsely. \u201cTell me, and I shall do it. My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her.\u201d The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy young sir, I do not ask so much as that\u2014not the last!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. \u201cCome!\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than me, better than my friend John.\u201d Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood\u2014to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me\u201d\u2014here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence\u2014\u201cbut, now you are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!\u201d Arthur turned to him and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy!\u201d said Van Helsing. \u201cIn the not-so-far-off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all went up to Lucy\u2019s room. Arthur by direction remained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.\u201d She had made the effort with success.\r\n\r\nIt astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his coat. Then he added: \u201cYou may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table. Friend John, help to me!\u201d So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing turning to me, said:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy\u2019s cheeks, and through Arthur\u2019s growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy\u2019s system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor\u2019s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: \u201cDo not stir an instant. It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.\u201d When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round\u2014the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.\u201d And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient\u2019s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing\u2019s ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: \u201cNow take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you have done. Good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that mark on her throat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not examined it yet,\u201d I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Van Helsing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI can make nothing of it.\u201d The Professor stood up. \u201cI must go back to Amsterdam to-night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are books and things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your sight pass from her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I have a nurse?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible. And then we may begin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay begin?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat on earth do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see!\u201d he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cRemember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary\u2014continued.\r\n\r\n8 September.\u2014I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter\u2019s renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not want to go to sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I am afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, not if you were like me\u2014if sleep was to you a presage of horror!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; oh, I don\u2019t know. And that is what is so terrible. All this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I can trust you!\u201d I seized the opportunity, and said: \u201cI promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will sleep!\u201d And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.\r\n\r\nAll night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my zo\u00f6phagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9 September.\u2014I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you.\u201d I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning. \u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cyou must stay here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once.\u201d I could not but acquiesce, for I was \u201cdog-tired,\u201d and could not have sat up had I tried. So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.\r\n\r\nLucy Westenra\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n9 September.\u2014I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me. And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God! Good-night, Arthur.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n10 September.\u2014I was conscious of the Professor\u2019s hand on my head, and started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how is our patient?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I left her, or rather when she left me,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, let us see,\u201d he said. And together we went into the room.\r\n\r\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.\r\n\r\nAs I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor\u2019s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, \u201cGott in Himmel!\u201d needed no enforcement from his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.\r\n\r\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly. \u201cQuick!\u201d he said. \u201cBring the brandy.\u201d I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.\u201d As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment\u2019s delay, we began the operation. After a time\u2014it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one\u2019s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling\u2014Van Helsing held up a warning finger. \u201cDo not stir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia.\u201d He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\r\n\r\nThe Professor watched me critically. \u201cThat will do,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready?\u201d I remonstrated. \u201cYou took a great deal more from Art.\u201d To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is her lover, her fianc\u00e9. You have work, much work, to do for her and for others; and the present will suffice.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges\u2014tiny though they were.\r\n\r\nLucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.\r\n\r\nLucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you do!\u201d As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: \u201cNow you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think even the most not-probable. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing\u2019s wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the \u201cforeign gentleman.\u201d I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy\u2019s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman\u2019s kindness. I got back here in time for a late dinner; went my rounds\u2014all well; and set this down whilst waiting for sleep. It is coming.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11 September.\u2014This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it with much impressment\u2014assumed, of course\u2014and showed a great bundle of white flowers.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are for you, Miss Lucy,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.\u201d Here Lucy made a wry face. \u201cNay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNo trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own.\u201d Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently: \u201cOh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience; and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor\u2019s actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacop\u0153ia that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I am!\u201d he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.\r\n\r\nWe then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said to her were:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cand thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want\u2014two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my \u2018spell\u2019 which I have work. Ho! ho!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLucy Westenra\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n12 September.\u2014How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with \u201cvirgin crants and maiden strewments.\u201d I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night, everybody.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n13 September.\u2014Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.\r\n\r\nLet all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o\u2019clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature\u2019s annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her.\u201d The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He rubbed his hands together, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,\u201d to which she answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy\u2019s state this morning is due in part to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow you do mean, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room. She was sleeping soundly\u2014so soundly that even my coming did not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor\u2019s face, and saw it turn ashen grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. \u201cGod! God! God!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!\u201d Suddenly he jumped to his feet. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201ccome, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.\u201d He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy\u2019s room.\r\n\r\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed. This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I expected,\u201d he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand. \u201cNo!\u201d he said. \u201cTo-day you must operate. I shall provide. You are weakened already.\u201d As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve.\r\n\r\nAgain the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.\r\n\r\nPresently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucy\u2019s room without consulting him; that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come.\r\n\r\nAfter another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.\r\n\r\nWhat does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.\r\n\r\nLucy Westenra\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n17 September.\u2014Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits\u2014the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what\u2014have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for mother\u2019s sake, and dear Arthur\u2019s, and for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Pall Mall Gazette,\u201d 18 September.\r\n\r\nTHE ESCAPED WOLF.\r\n\r\nPERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.\r\n\r\nInterview with the Keeper in the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens.\r\n\r\nAfter many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words \u201cPall Mall Gazette\u201d as a sort of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens in which the wolf department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called \u201cbusiness\u201d until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You\u2019ll excoose me refoosin\u2019 to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you mean, ask them questions?\u201d I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humour.\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2019Ittin\u2019 of them over the \u2019ead with a pole is one way; scratchin\u2019 of their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals. I don\u2019t so much mind the fust\u2014the \u2019ittin\u2019 with a pole afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they\u2019ve \u2019ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear-scratchin\u2019. Mind you,\u201d he added philosophically, \u201cthere\u2019s a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here\u2019s you a-comin\u2019 and arskin\u2019 of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that only for your bloomin\u2019 \u2019arf-quid I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 seen you blowed fust \u2019fore I\u2019d answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I\u2019d like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence did I tell yer to go to \u2019ell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 when you said you\u2019d report me for usin\u2019 of obscene language that was \u2019ittin\u2019 me over the \u2019ead; but the \u2019arf-quid made that all right. I weren\u2019t a-goin\u2019 to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my \u2019owl as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor\u2019 love yer \u2019art, now that the old \u2019ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an\u2019 rinsed me out with her bloomin\u2019 old teapot, and I\u2019ve lit hup, you may scratch my ears for all you\u2019re worth, and won\u2019t git even a growl out of me. Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin\u2019 at, that \u2019ere escaped wolf.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it happened; and when I know the facts I\u2019ll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, guv\u2019nor. This \u2019ere is about the \u2019ole story. That \u2019ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from Norway to Jamrach\u2019s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I\u2019m more surprised at \u2019im for wantin\u2019 to get out nor any other animile in the place. But, there, you can\u2019t trust wolves no more nor women.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mind him, sir!\u201d broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. \u201c \u2019E\u2019s got mindin\u2019 the animiles so long that blest if he ain\u2019t like a old wolf \u2019isself! But there ain\u2019t no \u2019arm in \u2019im.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, it was about two hours after feedin\u2019 yesterday when I first hear my disturbance. I was makin\u2019 up a litter in the monkey-house for a young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin\u2019 and \u2019owlin\u2019 I kem away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin\u2019 like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn\u2019t much people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a \u2019ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin\u2019 through it. He had a \u2019ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was \u2019im as they was hirritated at. He \u2019ad white kid gloves on \u2019is \u2019ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says: \u2018Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Maybe it\u2019s you,\u2019 says I, for I did not like the airs as he give \u2019isself. He didn\u2019t git angry, as I \u2019oped he would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. \u2018Oh no, they wouldn\u2019t like me,\u2019 \u2019e says.\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Ow yes, they would,\u2019 says I, a-imitatin\u2019 of him. \u2018They always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you \u2019as a bagful.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin\u2019 they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn\u2019t put in his hand and stroke the old wolf\u2019s ears too!\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Tyke care,\u2019 says I. \u2018Bersicker is quick.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Never mind,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m used to \u2019em!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Are you in the business yourself?\u2019 I says, tyking off my \u2019at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018No\u2019 says he, \u2018not exactly in the business, but I \u2019ave made pets of several.\u2019 And with that he lifts his \u2019at as perlite as a lord, and walks away. Old Bersicker kep\u2019 a-lookin\u2019 arter \u2019im till \u2019e was out of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn\u2019t come hout the \u2019ole hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here all began a-\u2019owling. There warn\u2019t nothing for them to \u2019owl at. There warn\u2019t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin\u2019 a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the \u2019owling stopped. Just before twelve o\u2019clock I just took a look round afore turnin\u2019 in, an\u2019, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker\u2019s cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And that\u2019s all I know for certing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid any one else see anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of our gard\u2019ners was a-comin\u2019 \u2019ome about that time from a \u2019armony, when he sees a big grey dog comin\u2019 out through the garding \u2019edges. At least, so he says, but I don\u2019t give much for it myself, for if he did \u2019e never said a word about it to his missis when \u2019e got \u2019ome, and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all night-a-huntin\u2019 of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein\u2019 anything. My own belief was that the \u2019armony \u2019ad got into his \u2019ead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, \u201cI think I can; but I don\u2019t know as \u2019ow you\u2019d be satisfied with the theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, can\u2019t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that \u2019ere wolf escaped\u2014simply because he wanted to get out.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I could see that it had done service before, and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn\u2019t cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Bilder, we\u2019ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you\u2019ve told me what you think will happen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight y\u2019are, sir,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cYe\u2019ll excoose me, I know, for a-chaffin\u2019 of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much as telling me to go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I never!\u201d said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy opinion is this: that \u2019ere wolf is a-\u2019idin\u2019 of, somewheres. The gard\u2019ner wot didn\u2019t remember said he was a-gallopin\u2019 northward faster than a horse could go; but I don\u2019t believe him, for, yer see, sir, wolves don\u2019t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein\u2019 built that way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin\u2019 somethin\u2019 that\u2019s more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But, Lor\u2019 bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in \u2019im. This one ain\u2019t been used to fightin\u2019 or even to providin\u2019 for hisself, and more like he\u2019s somewhere round the Park a-\u2019idin\u2019 an\u2019 a-shiverin\u2019 of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin\u2019 where he is to get his breakfast from; or maybe he\u2019s got down some area and is in a coal-cellar. My eye, won\u2019t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can\u2019t get food he\u2019s bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher\u2019s shop in time. If he doesn\u2019t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin\u2019 orf with a soldier, leavin\u2019 of the hinfant in the perambulator\u2014well, then I shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up against the window, and Mr. Bilder\u2019s face doubled its natural length with surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless me!\u201d he said. \u201cIf there ain\u2019t old Bersicker come back by \u2019isself!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all picture-wolves\u2014Red Riding Hood\u2019s quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble; didn\u2019t I say it all along? Here\u2019s his head all cut and full of broken glass. \u2019E\u2019s been a-gettin\u2019 over some bloomin\u2019 wall or other. It\u2019s a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles. This \u2019ere\u2019s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report.\r\n\r\nI came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n17 September.\u2014I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendent\u2019s study is almost unknown. Without an instant\u2019s pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely. Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again: \u201cThe blood is the life! The blood is the life!\u201d\r\n\r\nI cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy\u2019s illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without it.\r\n\r\nTelegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax.\r\n\r\n(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by twenty-two hours.)\r\n\r\n\u201c17 September.\u2014Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n18 September.\u2014Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van Helsing\u2019s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is possible that all may be well, but what may have happened? Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy\u2019s phonograph.\r\n\r\nMemorandum left by Lucy Westenra.\r\n\r\n17 September. Night.\u2014I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing.\r\n\r\nI went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room\u2014as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be\u2014so that I might have called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: \u201cIs there anybody there?\u201d There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog\u2019s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right.\u201d\r\n\r\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over\u2014as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother\u2019s poor body, which seemed to grow cold already\u2014for her dear heart had ceased to beat\u2014weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.\r\n\r\nThe time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother\u2019s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn\u2019t like to remove them, and, besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them.\r\n\r\nMy heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother\u2019s doctor uses for her\u2014oh! did use\u2014was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window.\r\n\r\nThe air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\r\n\r\n18 September.\u2014I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early. Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour\u2014for it was now ten o\u2019clock\u2014and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.\r\n\r\nI could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse\u2019s feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you not get my telegram?\u201d\r\n\r\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I fear we are too late. God\u2019s will be done!\u201d With his usual recuperative energy, he went on: \u201cCome. If there be no way open to get in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants\u2019 rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: \u201cWe can attend to them later.\u201d Then we ascended to Lucy\u2019s room. For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room.\r\n\r\nHow shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother\u2019s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy\u2019s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!\u201d\r\n\r\nI flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands. He said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything more.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\r\n\r\nI never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest. I knew\u2014as he knew\u2014that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\u201d He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\r\n\r\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect. Lucy\u2019s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing\u2019s face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first gain is ours! Check to the King!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must consult as to what is to be done,\u201d he said as we descended the stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van Helsing\u2019s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl\u2019s life won\u2019t be worth an hour\u2019s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with me, anyhow?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \u201cQuincey Morris!\u201d and rushed towards him with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat brought you here?\u201d I cried as our hands met.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess Art is the cause.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe handed me a telegram:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHave not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is. Do not delay.\u2014Holmwood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell me what to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cA brave man\u2019s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble. You\u2019re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against us for all he\u2019s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\u201d\r\n\r\nOnce again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper saying only: \u201cIt dropped from Lucy\u2019s breast when we carried her to the bath.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him: \u201cIn God\u2019s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\u201d I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what is it that you came to me to say?\u201d This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the more for it! Now go.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves?\u201d I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature. So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cJack Seward, I don\u2019t want to shove myself in anywhere where I\u2019ve no right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that\u2019s all past and gone, I can\u2019t help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that\u2019s wrong with her? The Dutchman\u2014and a fine old fellow he is; I can see that\u2014said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have another transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d I said, and he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day. Is not that so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn\u2019t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\u201d As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him\u2014and there was a royal lot of it, too\u2014to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: \u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how long has this been going on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout ten days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn\u2019t hold it.\u201d Then, coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \u201cWhat took it out?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cis the crux. Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits\u2019 end. I can\u2019t even hazard a guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well\u2014or ill.\u201d Quincey held out his hand. \u201cCount me in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy\u2019s first movement was to feel in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that meant\u2014that she had realised to the full her mother\u2019s death; so we tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19 September.\u2014All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy\u2019s strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him at the station.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived it was nearly six o\u2019clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened. Arthur\u2019s presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly one o\u2019clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy\u2019s phonograph. Until six o\u2019clock they are to try to rest. I fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.\r\n\r\nLetter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.\r\n(Unopened by her.)\r\n\r\n\u201c17 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Lucy,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After dinner Mr. Hawkins said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.\u2019 I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks\u2014and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it, dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his \u2018respectful duty,\u2019 but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply his \u2018love\u2019 instead. Good-bye, my dearest Lucy, and all blessings on you.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours,\r\n\u201cMina Harker.\u201d\r\n\r\nReport from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I., etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D.\r\n\r\n\u201c20 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Sir,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIn accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier\u2019s cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours\u2014the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of Renfield\u2019s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to \u201cshut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,\u201d whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: \u2018Lor\u2019 bless yer, sir, I wouldn\u2019t mind what was said to me in a bloomin\u2019 madhouse. I pity ye and the guv\u2019nor for havin\u2019 to live in the house with a wild beast like that.\u2019 Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: \u2018I\u2019ll frustrate them! They shan\u2019t rob me! they shan\u2019t murder me by inches! I\u2019ll fight for my Lord and Master!\u2019 and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right; and he is going on well.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so \u2018bloomin\u2019 good a bloke\u2019 as your correspondent. I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as follows:\u2014Jack Smollet, of Dudding\u2019s Rents, King George\u2019s Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley\u2019s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master\u2019s Yard, Soho.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance.\r\n\r\n\u201cBelieve me, dear Sir,\r\n\u201cYours faithfully,\r\n\u201cPatrick Hennessey.\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.\r\n(Unopened by her.)\r\n\r\n\u201c18 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Lucy,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly. Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man\u2019s death is a real blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his\u2014a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend\u2019s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years\u2014should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,\r\n\r\n\u201cYour loving\r\n\u201cMina Harker.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n20 September.\u2014Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late\u2014Lucy\u2019s mother and Arthur\u2019s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.\r\n\r\nI duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. \u201cCome, my child,\u201d he said; \u201ccome with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.\u201d Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy\u2019s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy\u2019s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round\u2014doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim\u2014and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.\r\n\r\nPresently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.\r\n\r\nAt six o\u2019clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy\u2019s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: \u201cDraw up the blind; I want light!\u201d Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy\u2019s, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, \u201cMein Gott!\u201d as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.\r\n\r\nThe wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. \u201cCome,\u201d I said, \u201cmy dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we came into Lucy\u2019s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy\u2019s hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!\u201d He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, \u201cnot yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAnd then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!\u201d Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for your life!\u201d he said; \u201cnot for your living soul and hers!\u201d And he stood between them like a lion at bay.\r\n\r\nArthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.\r\n\r\nI kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing\u2019s great brown one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. \u201cMy true friend,\u201d she said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, \u201cMy true friend, and his! Oh, guard him, and give me peace!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear it!\u201d he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him: \u201cCome, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.\r\n\r\nLucy\u2019s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur\u2019s arm, and drew him away.\r\n\r\nAnd then Lucy\u2019s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is all over,\u201d said Van Helsing. \u201cShe is dead!\u201d\r\n\r\nI took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.\r\n\r\nI went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body. Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be.\r\n\u201cWe thought her dying whilst she slept,\r\nAnd sleeping when she died.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stood beside Van Helsing, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\u2014continued.\r\n\r\nTHE funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted\u2014or blessed\u2014with something of his own obsequious suavity. Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from the death-chamber:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cShe makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It\u2019s quite a privilege to attend on her. It\u2019s not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment!\u201d\r\n\r\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father\u2019s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy\u2019s papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more\u2014such as this.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been in Lucy\u2019s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy\u2019s old room all night, and I myself search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra\u2019s solicitor and had written to him. All the poor lady\u2019s papers were in order; explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you got what you looked for?\u201d I asked, to which he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was\u2014only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy\u2019s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of \u201cdecay\u2019s effacing fingers,\u201d had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: \u201cRemain till I return,\u201d and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away.\r\n\r\nI was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMust we make an autopsy?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father\u2019s funeral to-morrow, and he will want to see her\u2014to see it. Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it\u2014no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge\u2014why do it? Without such it is monstrous.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err\u2014I am but man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love\u2014though she was dying\u2014and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is not perhaps well. And if I work\u2014as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust\u2014without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel, oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!\u201d He paused a moment and went on solemnly: \u201cFriend John, there are strange and terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end. Will you not have faith in me?\u201d\r\n\r\nI took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage\u2014she had her back towards me, so did not see me\u2014and go into the room where Lucy lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cit is too late\u2014or too early. See!\u201d Here he held up the little golden crucifix. \u201cThis was stolen in the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, stolen,\u201d I asked in wonder, \u201csince you have it now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with.\r\n\r\nThe forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy\u2019s father\u2019s which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had told us so much he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFrankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment. Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will\u2014and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case\u2014have been treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part\u2014in which he was officially interested\u2014of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.\r\n\r\nHe did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o\u2019clock, so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fianc\u00e9e quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don\u2019t know how to thank you for all you have done for her. I can\u2019t think yet....\u201d\r\n\r\nHere he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast, crying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.\u201d\r\n\r\nI comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man\u2019s heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCome and look at her.\u201d\r\n\r\nTogether we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face. God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cJack, is she really dead?\u201d\r\n\r\nI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest\u2014for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could help\u2014that it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.\r\n\r\nI left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker\u2019s men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur\u2019s question, and he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but when we had lit our cigars he said\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLord\u2014\u2014\u201d; but Arthur interrupted him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, not that, for God\u2019s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir: I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so recent.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Professor answered very sweetly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you \u2018Mr.,\u2019 and I have grown to love you\u2014yes, my dear boy, to love you\u2014as Arthur.\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur held out his hand, and took the old man\u2019s warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cCall me what you will,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I may always have the title of a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear.\u201d He paused a moment, and went on: \u201cI know that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so\u2014you remember\u201d\u2014the Professor nodded\u2014\u201cyou must forgive me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe answered with a grave kindness:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not\u2014that you cannot\u2014trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot\u2014and may not\u2014and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, indeed, indeed, sir,\u201d said Arthur warmly, \u201cI shall in all ways trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are Jack\u2019s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I ask you something now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, poor dear; I never thought of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy\u2019s papers and letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them\u2014no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back to you. It\u2019s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy\u2019s sake?\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too\u2014you most of all, my dear boy\u2014will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well!\u201d\r\n\r\nI slept on a sofa in Arthur\u2019s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n22 September.\u2014In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.\r\n\r\nIt seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand\u2014see what unexpected prosperity does for us\u2014so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow....\r\n\r\nThe service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....\r\n\r\nWe came back to town quietly, taking a \u2019bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can\u2019t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn\u2019t know anybody who saw us\u2014and we didn\u2019t care if they did\u2014so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano\u2019s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath: \u201cMy God!\u201d I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.\r\n\r\nHe was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal\u2019s. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did: \u201cDo you see who it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, dear,\u201d I said; \u201cI don\u2019t know him; who is it?\u201d His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the man himself!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe poor dear was evidently terrified at something\u2014very greatly terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!\u201d He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place. After a few minutes\u2019 staring at nothing, Jonathan\u2019s eyes closed, and he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude. Come, and we\u2019ll have a cup of tea somewhere.\u201d He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of. I don\u2019t like this lapsing into forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014A sad home-coming in every way\u2014the house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nOh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our troubles.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n22 September.\u2014It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy\u2019s death as any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy\u2019s veins; I could see Van Helsing\u2019s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you don\u2019t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, \u2018May I come in?\u2019 is not the true laughter. No! he is a king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no time of suitability. He say, \u2018I am here.\u2019 Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave\u2014laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say \u2018Thud! thud!\u2019 to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy\u2014that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man\u2014not even to you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son\u2014yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, \u2018Here I am! here I am!\u2019 till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall\u2014all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it was the grim irony of it all\u2014this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going \u2018Toll! toll! toll!\u2019 so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, for the life of me, Professor,\u201d I said, \u201cI can\u2019t see anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church\u2019s law, though no wits, all gone\u2014even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see where the joke comes in there either!\u201d I said; and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid his hand on my arm, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh; if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him\u2014for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time\u2014maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I know!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.\r\n\r\nSo I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work, I say sadly and without hope,\r\n\r\n\u201cFINIS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Westminster Gazette,\u201d 25 September.\r\n\r\nA HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as \u201cThe Kensington Horror,\u201d or \u201cThe Stabbing Woman,\u201d or \u201cThe Woman in Black.\u201d During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a \u201cbloofer lady.\u201d It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a \u201cbloofer lady\u201d had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the \u201cbloofer lady\u201d is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the \u201cbloofer lady\u201d should be the popular r\u00f4le at these al fresco performances. Our correspondent na\u00efvely says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend\u2014and even imagine themselves\u2014to be.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Westminster Gazette,\u201d 25 September.\r\n\r\nExtra Special.\r\n\r\nTHE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.\r\n\r\nANOTHER CHILD INJURED.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cBloofer Lady.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe have just received intelligence that another child, missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the Shooter\u2019s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common story to tell of being lured away by the \u201cbloofer lady.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMINA HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\r\n\r\n23 September.\u2014Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it....\r\n\r\n24 September.\u2014I hadn\u2019t the heart to write last night; that terrible record of Jonathan\u2019s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our wedding-day he said: \u201cUnless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.\u201d There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.\r\n\r\nLetter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker.\r\n\r\n\u201c24 September.\r\n(Confidence)\r\n\r\n\u201cDear Madam,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra\u2019s death. By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is for others\u2019 good that I ask\u2014to redress great wrong, and to lift much and terrible troubles\u2014that may be more great than you can know. May it be that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be, enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.\r\n\r\n\u201cVan Helsing.\u201d\r\n\r\nTelegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing.\r\n\r\n\u201c25 September.\u2014Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch it. Can see you any time you call.\r\n\r\n\u201cWilhelmina Harker.\u201d\r\n\r\nMINA HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n25 September.\u2014I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jonathan\u2019s sad experience; and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.\r\n\r\nI suppose a cry does us all good at times\u2014clears the air as other rain does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him. It is two o\u2019clock, and the doctor will be here soon now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan\u2019s journal unless he asks me. I am so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan\u2019s journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to him\u2014terrible though it be and awful in its consequences\u2014to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter which\u2014waking or dreaming\u2014may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur\u2019s friend and Dr. Seward\u2019s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan\u2019s friend on \u201cThe Exeter News\u201d told him that memory was everything in such work\u2014that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare interview; I shall try to record it verbatim.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past two o\u2019clock when the knock came. I took my courage \u00e0 deux mains and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and announced \u201cDr. Van Helsing.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man\u2019s moods. He said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Harker, is it not?\u201d I bowed assent.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was Miss Mina Murray?\u201d Again I assented.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d I said, \u201cyou could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.\u201d And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good, but I had yet to learn\u2014\u2014\u201d He finished his speech with a courtly bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary\u2014you need not look surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in imitation of you\u2014and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always so with young ladies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.\u201d I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit\u2014I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths\u2014so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I read it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you wish,\u201d I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you so clever woman!\u201d he said. \u201cI knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things. And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me? Alas! I know not the shorthand.\u201d By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d I said: \u201cI could not help it; but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time to wait\u2014not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious\u2014I have written it out on the typewriter for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took it and his eyes glistened. \u201cYou are so good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd may I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d I said, \u201cread it over whilst I order lunch; and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat.\u201d He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Madam Mina,\u201d he said, \u201chow can I say what I owe to you? This paper is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman. Madam\u201d\u2014he said this very solemnly\u2014\u201cif ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know. It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights; you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and your husband will be blessed in you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, doctor, you praise me too much, and\u2014and you do not know me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot know you\u2014I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels\u2019 eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your husband\u2014tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?\u201d I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins\u2019s death.\u201d He interrupted:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.\u201d I went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of a shock was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something which led to his brain fever.\u201d And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever\u2014and it has grown with my advancing years\u2014the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope\u2014hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life happy\u2014good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do all for him that I can\u2014all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan\u2019s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now tell me all about him.\u201d When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman\u2014that journal is all so strange\u2014and I hesitated to go on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half believed some very strange things.\u201d He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little of any one\u2019s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan\u2019s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell me what you think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise,\u201d he said as I gave him the papers; \u201cI shall in the morning, so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington before eight.\u201d He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry.\r\n\r\nSo he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here thinking\u2014thinking I don\u2019t know what.\r\n\r\nLetter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker.\r\n\r\n\u201c25 September, 6 o\u2019clock.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear Madam Mina,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI have read your husband\u2019s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is true! I will pledge my life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men, that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room\u2014ay, and going a second time\u2014is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle\u2014dazzle more than ever, and I must think.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours the most faithful,\r\n\u201cAbraham Van Helsing.\u201d\r\n\r\nLetter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing.\r\n\r\n\u201c25 September, 6:30 p. m.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Dr. Van Helsing,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cA thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come to breakfast at eight o\u2019clock, if this be not too early for you? You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cBelieve me,\r\n\u201cYour faithful and grateful friend,\r\n\u201cMina Harker.\u201d\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n26 September.\u2014I thought never to write in this diary again, but the time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing\u2019s visit, and of her having given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me. She showed me in the doctor\u2019s letter that all I wrote down was true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I know, I am not afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....\r\n\r\nHe was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.\u201d It was so funny to hear my wife called \u201cMadam Mina\u201d by this kindly, strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI was ill, I have had a shock; but you have cured me already.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted myself. Doctor, you don\u2019t know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don\u2019t; you couldn\u2019t with eyebrows like yours.\u201d He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSo! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.\u201d I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded and stood silent.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is one of God\u2019s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist\u2014and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish. And you, sir\u2014I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, \u201cmay I ask you for some more help? I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here. Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, sir,\u201d I said, \u201cdoes what you have to do concern the Count?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does,\u201d he said solemnly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take them with you and read them in the train.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall both come when you will,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nI had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them, \u201cThe Westminster Gazette\u201d\u2014I knew it by the colour\u2014and he grew quite white. He read something intently, groaning to himself: \u201cMein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!\u201d I do not think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand, calling out: \u201cLove to Madam Mina; I shall write so soon as ever I can.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n26 September.\u2014Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I said \u201cFinis,\u201d and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o\u2019clock, and thrust last night\u2019s \u201cWestminster Gazette\u201d into my hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d he asked as he stood back and folded his arms.\r\n\r\nI looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, and I looked up. \u201cWell?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is like poor Lucy\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do you make of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSimply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured her has injured them.\u201d I did not quite understand his answer:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is true indirectly, but not directly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you mean, Professor?\u201d I asked. I was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly\u2014for, after all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one\u2019s spirits\u2014but when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me!\u201d I said. \u201cI can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how the blood lost or waste?\u201d I shook my head. He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men\u2019s eyes, because they know\u2014or think they know\u2014some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young\u2014like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cCharcot has proved that pretty well.\u201d He smiled as he went on: \u201cThen you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot\u2014alas that he is no more!\u2014into the very soul of the patient that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank? No? Then tell me\u2014for I am student of the brain\u2014how you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricity\u2014who would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and \u2018Old Parr\u2019 one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men\u2019s blood in her poor veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then\u2014and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God, Professor!\u201d I said, starting up. \u201cDo you mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?\u201d He waved his hand for silence, and went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint? Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and women who cannot die? We all know\u2014because science has vouched for the fact\u2014that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?\u201d Here I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind his list of nature\u2019s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cProfessor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where I am going.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is good image,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I shall tell you. My thesis is this: I want you to believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo believe what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith: \u2018that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.\u2019 For one, I follow that man. He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read your lesson aright?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children\u2019s throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d He stood up and said solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse, far, far worse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn God\u2019s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were made by Miss Lucy!\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\u2014continued.\r\n\r\nFOR a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Van Helsing, are you mad?\u201d He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. \u201cWould I were!\u201d he said. \u201cMadness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death? Ah no!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d said I. He went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the \u2018no\u2019 of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove it. Dare you come with me?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron excepted from the category, jealousy.\r\n\u201cAnd prove the very truth he most abhorred.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe saw my hesitation, and spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe logic is simple, no madman\u2019s logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d He took a key from his pocket and held it up. \u201cAnd then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to Arthur.\u201d My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing....\r\n\r\nWe found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy\u2019s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. \u201cOut of so many harmless ones,\u201d he said, \u201cthere may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this \u2018bloofer lady\u2019 scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the \u2018bloofer lady.\u2019 \u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cthat when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not healed.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe dined at \u201cJack Straw\u2019s Castle\u201d along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o\u2019clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty\u2014for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us\u2014we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life\u2014animal life\u2014was not the only thing which could pass away.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy\u2019s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.\u201d Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: \u201cYou shall see,\u201d and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.\r\n\r\nI drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. \u201cAre you satisfied now, friend John?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\nI felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am satisfied that Lucy\u2019s body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what is that, friend John?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat it is not there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is good logic,\u201d he said, \u201cso far as it goes. But how do you\u2014how can you\u2014account for it not being there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps a body-snatcher,\u201d I suggested. \u201cSome of the undertaker\u2019s people may have stolen it.\u201d I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. \u201cAh well!\u201d he said, \u201cwe must have more proof. Come with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying: \u201cWill you keep it? You had better be assured.\u201d I laughed\u2014it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say\u2014as I motioned him to keep it. \u201cA key is nothing,\u201d I said; \u201cthere may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind.\u201d He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.\r\n\r\nIt was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor\u2019s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not see the child?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see,\u201d said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.\r\n\r\nWhen we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child\u2019s throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.\r\n\r\n\u201cWas I right?\u201d I asked triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were just in time,\u201d said the Professor thankfully.\r\n\r\nWe had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman\u2019s heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a cab near the \u201cSpaniards,\u201d and drove to town.\r\n\r\nI cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours\u2019 sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n27 September.\u2014It was two o\u2019clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy\u2019s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.\r\n\r\nThere lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this a juggle?\u201d I said to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you convinced now?\u201d said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee,\u201d he went on, \u201csee, they are even sharper than before. With this and this\u201d\u2014and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it\u2014\u201cthe little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend John?\u201d Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cShe may have been placed here since last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? That is so, and by whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know. Some one has done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not look so.\u201d I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking\u2014oh, you start; you do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later\u2014and in trance could he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home\u201d\u2014as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was \u201chome\u201d\u2014\u201ctheir face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.\u201d This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing\u2019s theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you believe now?\u201d\r\n\r\nI answered: \u201cDo not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to accept. How will you do this bloody work?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body.\u201d It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?\r\n\r\nI waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy\u2019s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child\u2019s at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die\u2014if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.\r\n\r\nNote left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to John Seward, M. D.\r\n\r\n(Not delivered.)\r\n\r\n\u201c27 September.\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend John,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager. Therefore I shall fix some things she like not\u2014garlic and a crucifix\u2014and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy\u2019s life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me; but none other shall\u2014until it be too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cTherefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the world may rest from him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it be so, farewell.\r\n\r\n\u201cVan Helsing.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n28 September.\u2014It is wonderful what a good night\u2019s sleep will do for one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing\u2019s monstrous ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some light on the mystery.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n29 September, morning..... Last night, at a little before ten o\u2019clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing\u2019s room; he told us all that he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too, \u201cfor,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is a grave duty to be done there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?\u201d This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I\u2019m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d said Quincey Morris laconically.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the Professor, \u201cthen you are nearer the beginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time\u2014I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be\u2014you shall not blame yourselves for anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s frank anyhow,\u201d broke in Quincey. \u201cI\u2019ll answer for the Professor. I don\u2019t quite see his drift, but I swear he\u2019s honest; and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you, sir,\u201d said Van Helsing proudly. \u201cI have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me.\u201d He held out a hand, which Quincey took.\r\n\r\nThen Arthur spoke out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Van Helsing, I don\u2019t quite like to \u2018buy a pig in a poke,\u2019 as they say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise. If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI accept your limitation,\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cand all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAgreed!\u201d said Arthur; \u201cthat is only fair. And now that the pourparlers are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at Kingstead.\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur\u2019s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere poor Lucy is buried?\u201d The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: \u201cAnd when there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo enter the tomb!\u201d Arthur stood up.\r\n\r\n\u201cProfessor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest.\u201d He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was silence until he asked again:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when in the tomb?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo open the coffin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is too much!\u201d he said, angrily rising again. \u201cI am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this\u2014this desecration of the grave\u2014of one who\u2014\u2014\u201d He fairly choked with indignation. The Professor looked pityingly at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,\u201d he said, \u201cGod knows I would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur looked up with set white face and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care, sir, take care!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould it not be well to hear what I have to say?\u201d said Van Helsing. \u201cAnd then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair enough,\u201d broke in Morris.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to her. But if she be not dead\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has she been buried alive?\u201d He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUn-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeavens and earth, no!\u201d cried Arthur in a storm of passion. \u201cNot for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or am I mad to listen to them? Don\u2019t dare to think more of such a desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do it!\u201d\r\n\r\nVan Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then\u2014then I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship\u2019s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will.\u201d His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her\u2014I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness\u2014I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days\u2014before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\u201d He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man\u2019s hand and said in a broken voice:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I shall go with you and wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\u2014continued\r\n\r\nIT was just a quarter before twelve o\u2019clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was.\u201d The Professor turned to the rest saying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.\u201d He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.\r\n\r\nThe coffin was empty!\r\n\r\nFor several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cProfessor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn\u2019t ask such a thing ordinarily\u2014I wouldn\u2019t so dishonour you as to imply a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour. Is this your doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here\u2014with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So\u201d\u2014here he shut the dark slide of his lantern\u2014\u201cnow to the outside.\u201d He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.\r\n\r\nOh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing\u2014like the gladness and sorrow of a man\u2019s life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing\u2019s conclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd is that stuff you have put there going to do it?\u201d asked Quincey. \u201cGreat Scott! Is this a game?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that which you are using?\u201d This time the question was by Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.\u201d It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor\u2019s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.\r\n\r\nThere was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen \u201cS-s-s-s!\u201d He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance\u2014a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor\u2019s warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy\u2019s face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.\r\n\r\nWe shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing\u2019s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.\r\n\r\nWhen Lucy\u2014I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape\u2014saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy\u2019s eyes in form and colour; but Lucy\u2019s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nShe still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCome to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was something diabolically sweet in her tones\u2014something of the tingling of glass when struck\u2014which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.\r\n\r\nWhen within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing\u2019s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa\u2019s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death\u2014if looks could kill\u2014we saw it at that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnswer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;\u201d and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, he lifted the child and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night; and then to home.\u201d Coming close to Arthur, he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n29 September, night.\u2014A little before twelve o\u2019clock we three\u2014Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself\u2014called for the Professor. It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.\r\n\r\nWhen we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy\u2019s coffin we all looked\u2014Arthur trembling like an aspen\u2014and saw that the body lay there in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy\u2019s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur\u2019s face grow hard as he looked. Presently he said to Van Helsing:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this really Lucy\u2019s body, or only a demon in her shape?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her as she was, and is.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth\u2014which it made one shudder to see\u2014the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy\u2019s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor\u2019s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, Van Helsing said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: \u2018It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?\u2019 Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!\u201d Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBrave lad! A moment\u2019s courage, and it is done. This stake must be driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal\u2014be not deceived in that\u2014but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Arthur hoarsely. \u201cTell me what I am to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for the dead\u2014I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow\u2014strike in God\u2019s name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.\r\n\r\nThe Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault.\r\n\r\nAnd then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over.\r\n\r\nThe hammer fell from Arthur\u2019s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.\r\n\r\nThere, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder, and said to him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man\u2019s hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cForgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace.\u201d He put his hands on the Professor\u2019s shoulder, and laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning devil now\u2014not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is the devil\u2019s Un-Dead. She is God\u2019s true dead, whose soul is with Him!\u201d\r\n\r\nArthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur.\r\n\r\nOutside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.\r\n\r\nBefore we moved away Van Helsing said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all of us\u2014is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end?\u201d\r\n\r\nEach in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the Professor as we moved off:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\u2014continued\r\n\r\nWHEN we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAm coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.\u2014Mina Harker.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Professor was delighted. \u201cAh, that wonderful Madam Mina,\u201d he said, \u201cpearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her en route, so that she may be prepared.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker\u2019s diary at Whitby. \u201cTake these,\u201d he said, \u201cand study them well. When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What is here told,\u201d he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, \u201cmay be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we shall go through all these together when we meet.\u201d He then made ready for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in.\r\n\r\nThe crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and, after a quick glance, said: \u201cDr. Seward, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are Mrs. Harker!\u201d I answered at once; whereupon she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but\u2014\u2014\u201d She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.\r\n\r\nThe blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.\r\n\r\nIn due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered.\r\n\r\nShe told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here she is!\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n29 September.\u2014After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward\u2019s study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, and on his calling out, \u201cCome in,\u201d I entered.\r\n\r\nTo my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much interested.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope I did not keep you waiting,\u201d I said; \u201cbut I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he replied with a smile, \u201cI was only entering my diary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour diary?\u201d I asked him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI keep it in this.\u201d As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact is,\u201d he began awkwardly, \u201cI only keep my diary in it; and as it is entirely\u2014almost entirely\u2014about my cases, it may be awkward\u2014that is, I mean\u2014\u2014\u201d He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died; for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very dear to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTell you of her death? Not for the wide world!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse. At length he stammered out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary.\u201d Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of a child: \u201cThat\u2019s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!\u201d I could not but smile, at which he grimaced. \u201cI gave myself away that time!\u201d he said. \u201cBut do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?\u201d By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter.\u201d He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn\u2019t let you know that terrible story!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking, followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not know me,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you have read those papers\u2014my own diary and my husband\u2019s also, which I have typed\u2014you will know me better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause; but, of course, you do not know me\u2014yet; and I must not expect you to trust me so far.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you. But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them\u2014the first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things.\u201d He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already....\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n29 September.\u2014I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said: \u201cShe is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,\u201d and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker\u2019s diary, when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI greatly fear I have distressed you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, not distressed me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I have been more touched than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart. It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one need ever know, shall ever know,\u201d I said in a low voice. She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but they must!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMust! But why?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy\u2019s death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us; working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark.\u201d She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes. \u201cYou shall,\u201d I said, \u201cdo as you like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucy\u2019s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the dark. Nay, the end\u2014the very end\u2014may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us; we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask\u2014if there be anything which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present.\u201d\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n29 September.\u2014After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.\r\n\r\nWhen the terrible story of Lucy\u2019s death, and\u2014and all that followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan\u2019s experience in Transylvania I could not have believed. As it was, I didn\u2019t know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him when they come.\u201d He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of good men\u2014even if there are monsters in it. Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor\u2019s perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of \u201cThe Westminster Gazette\u201d and \u201cThe Pall Mall Gazette,\u201d and took them to my room. I remember how much \u201cThe Dailygraph\u201d and \u201cThe Whitby Gazette,\u201d of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n30 September.\u2014Mr. Harker arrived at nine o\u2019clock. He had got his wife\u2019s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true\u2014and judging by one\u2019s own wonderful experiences, it must be\u2014he is also a man of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife\u2019s typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it is....\r\n\r\nStrange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the Count\u2019s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh, if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have found the dates otherwise....\r\n\r\nI found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire\u2019s ultimate triumph? Stay; he is himself zo\u00f6phagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of \u201cmaster.\u201d This all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think, and then\u2014! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n29 September, in train to London.\u2014When I received Mr. Billington\u2019s courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count\u2019s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father\u2019s house, where they had decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count\u2019s table before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, he had \u201ctaken no chances,\u201d and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: \u201cFifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.\u201d Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description \u201cFifty cases of common earth.\u201d I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were \u201cmain and mortal heavy,\u201d and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn\u2019t any gentleman \u201csuch-like as yourself, squire,\u201d to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n30 September.\u2014The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at King\u2019s Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner.\r\n\r\nFrom thence I went on to Carter Paterson\u2019s central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King\u2019s Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers\u2019 men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThat \u2019ere \u2019ouse, guv\u2019nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it ain\u2019t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep\u2019 on it without \u2019urtin\u2019 of yer bones; an\u2019 the place was that neglected that yer might \u2019ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel\u2014that took the cike, that did! Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn\u2019t never git out quick enough. Lor\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.\r\n\r\nOf one thing I am now satisfied: that all the boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed\u2014as from Dr. Seward\u2019s diary I fear.\r\n\r\nI shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good deal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers into order.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal\r\n\r\n30 September.\u2014I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has, however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human\u2014not even beast. To read Dr. Seward\u2019s account of poor Lucy\u2019s death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one\u2019s heart.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy\u2019s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite \u201cblowing my trumpet,\u201d as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward\u2019s diary that they had been at Lucy\u2019s death\u2014her real death\u2014and that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over\u2014it does make a pretty good pile\u2014he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you write all this, Mrs. Harker?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded, and he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy\u2014\u201d Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. I suppose there is something in woman\u2019s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn\u2019t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I know he never will\u2014he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won\u2019t you let me be of some little service\u2014for Lucy\u2019s sake?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with emotion.\r\n\r\nWe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big sorrowing man\u2019s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.\r\n\r\nAfter a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for days and nights past\u2014weary days and sleepless nights\u2014he had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely. \u201cI know now how I suffered,\u201d he said, as he dried his eyes, \u201cbut I do not know even yet\u2014and none other can ever know\u2014how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives\u2014for dear Lucy\u2019s sake?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor dear Lucy\u2019s sake,\u201d I said as we clasped hands. \u201cAy, and for your own sake,\u201d he added, \u201cfor if a man\u2019s esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man\u2019s help, believe me, you will not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know.\u201d He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps. \u201cHow is Art?\u201d he said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on: \u201cAh, I see you have been comforting him. Poor old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise how much I knew; so I said to him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You will know, later on, why I speak.\u201d He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!\u201d Then he went into the study to his friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle girl!\u201d\u2014the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he proved himself a friend!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\r\n\r\n30 September.\u2014I got home at five o\u2019clock, and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers\u2019 men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like home. When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary interests me so much!\u201d She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,\u201d I answered. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d he said; \u201clet her come in, by all means; but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.\u201d His method of tidying was peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully: \u201cLet the lady come in,\u201d and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic\u2014for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening, Mr. Renfield,\u201d said she. \u201cYou see, I know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you.\u201d He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can\u2019t be, you know, for she\u2019s dead.\u201d Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t stay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why not?\u201d I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you know I wanted to marry any one?\u201d His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat an asinine question!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,\u201d said Mrs. Harker, at once championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi.\u201d I positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet lunatic\u2014the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with\u2014talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker\u2019s presence which had touched some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power.\r\n\r\nWe continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood\u2014relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, \u2018For the blood is the life.\u2019 Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn\u2019t that true, doctor?\u201d I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: \u201cGood-bye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,\u201d to which, to my astonishment, he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again. May He bless and keep you!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker\u2019s suggestion; at which the Professor interrupted me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man\u2019s brain\u2014a brain that a man should have were he much gifted\u2014and a woman\u2019s heart. The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are determined\u2014nay, are we not pledged?\u2014to destroy this monster; but it is no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer\u2014both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and we go alone.\u201d I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. \u201cOh that we had known it before!\u201d he said, \u201cfor then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, \u2018the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,\u2019 as you say. We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end.\u201d Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot up to this moment, Professor,\u201d she said impulsively, \u201cbut up to this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who has told is the worse for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except what is personal. Must it go in?\u201d The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more honour you\u2014as well as more esteem and love.\u201d She took it back with another blush and a bright smile.\r\n\r\nAnd so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner, and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o\u2019clock. The rest of us have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n30 September.\u2014When we met in Dr. Seward\u2019s study two hours after dinner, which had been at six o\u2019clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris\u2014Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the centre. The Professor said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers.\u201d We all expressed assent, and he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me. So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure according.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. \u2018See! see! I prove; I prove.\u2019 Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know\u2014nay, had I even guess at him\u2014one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat\u2014the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him\u2014without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God\u2019s sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What say you?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch\u2014so strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man\u2019s hand can speak for itself; it does not even need a woman\u2019s love to hear its music.\r\n\r\nWhen the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I in his; there was no need for speaking between us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI answer for Mina and myself,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cCount me in, Professor,\u201d said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am with you,\u201d said Lord Godalming, \u201cfor Lucy\u2019s sake, if for no other reason.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not without strength. We have on our side power of combination\u2014a power denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally. In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death\u2014nay of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the first place because we have to be\u2014no other means is at our control\u2014and secondly, because, after all, these things\u2014tradition and superstition\u2014are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for others\u2014though not, alas! for us\u2014on them? A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never! He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand\u2014witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create\u2014that noble ship\u2019s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust\u2014as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small\u2014we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire\u2014solder you call it. He can see in the dark\u2014no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature\u2019s laws\u2014why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the \u2018land beyond the forest.\u2019 That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the records are such words as \u2018stregoica\u2019\u2014witch, \u2018ordog,\u2019 and \u2018pokol\u2019\u2014Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as \u2018wampyr,\u2019 which we all understand too well. There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the latter, we must trace\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHere we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris\u2019s voice without:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about it.\u201d A minute later he came in and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you hit it?\u201d asked Dr. Van Helsing.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.\u201d Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it. Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well. You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we are.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their safety\u2014strength being the best safety\u2014through care of me; but their minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris resumed the discussion:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAs there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save another victim.\u201d\r\n\r\nI own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to get into the house.\r\n\r\nManlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n1 October, 4 a. m.\u2014Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me. I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don\u2019t know but what, if you don\u2019t see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits.\u201d I knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so I said: \u201cAll right; I\u2019ll go now\u201d; and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my \u201cpatient.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake me with you, friend John,\u201d said the Professor. \u201cHis case in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on our case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I come also?\u201d asked Lord Godalming.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe too?\u201d said Quincey Morris. \u201cMay I come?\u201d said Harker. I nodded, and we all went down the passage together.\r\n\r\nWe found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity. \u201cI appeal to your friends,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have not introduced me.\u201d I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man\u2019s manner, so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: \u201cLord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr. Renfield.\u201d He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances.\u201d He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm.\r\n\r\nI think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man\u2019s character and history, that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable. So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to go at once\u2014here\u2014now\u2014this very hour\u2014this very moment, if I may. Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.\u201d He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible that I have erred in my supposition?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have,\u201d I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for this concession\u2014boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends.\u201d Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards\u2014for it was as of one addressing an equal:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me\u2014a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind\u2014Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek.\u201d He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.\u201d He still shook his head as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.\u201d I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go out of this. You don\u2019t know what you do by keeping me here. I am speaking from the depths of my heart\u2014of my very soul. You don\u2019t know whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell. By all you hold sacred\u2014by all you hold dear\u2014by your love that is lost\u2014by your hope that lives\u2014for the sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt! Can\u2019t you hear me, man? Can\u2019t you understand? Will you never learn? Don\u2019t you know that I am sane and earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d I said sternly, \u201cno more of this; we have had quite enough already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had expected.\r\n\r\nWhen I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, well-bred voice:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\r\n\r\n1 October, 5 a. m.\u2014I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Jack, if that man wasn\u2019t attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw. I\u2019m not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance.\u201d Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I\u2019m glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say. All is best as they are.\u201d Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can\u2019t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count \u2018lord and master,\u2019 and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn\u2019t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.\u201d The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?\u201d Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThat old place may be full of rats, and if so, I\u2019ve got an antidote on call.\u201d Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind\u2014and therefore breakable or crushable\u2014his are not amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch. Keep this near your heart\u201d\u2014as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him\u2014\u201cput these flowers round your neck\u201d\u2014here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms\u2014\u201cfor other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless.\u201d This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others was similarly equipped. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cfriend John, where are the skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward\u2019s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra\u2019s tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn manus tuas, Domine!\u201d he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search.\r\n\r\nThe light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.\r\n\r\nThe whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider\u2019s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?\u201d I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands. \u201cThis is the spot,\u201d said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.\r\n\r\nWe made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we began:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest.\u201d A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.\r\n\r\nThere were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count\u2019s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, \u201cI thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows,\u201d and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for him. I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered from behind Dr. Seward\u2019s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house. Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.\r\n\r\nLord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.\r\n\r\nWith their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.\r\n\r\nThe morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front. Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far,\u201d he said, \u201cour night has been eminently successful. No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first\u2014and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous\u2014step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari: that the brute beasts which are to the Count\u2019s command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother\u2019s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster\u2014he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night. So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to cry \u2018check\u2019 in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night\u2019s work. It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield\u2019s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.\r\n\r\nI came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep dark over to-night\u2019s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1 October, later.\u2014I suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas Snelling to-day.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n1 October.\u2014It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night\u2019s work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYour patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound.\u201d I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient. \u201cBut,\u201d he answered, \u201cI want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, \u201cbut the answer is here.\u201d I laid my hand on the type-written matter. \u201cWhen our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room.\u201d Van Helsing smiled in turn. \u201cGood!\u201d he said. \u201cYour memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?\u201d I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study. \u201cDo I interrupt?\u201d he asked politely as he stood at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d I answered. \u201cCome in. My work is finished, and I am free. I can go with you now, if you like.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is needless; I have seen him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short. When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. \u201cDon\u2019t you know me?\u201d I asked. His answer was not reassuring: \u201cI know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!\u201d Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you with all my heart,\u201d I answered earnestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter. \u201cMrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n1 October.\u2014It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day; after Jonathan\u2019s full confidence for so many years, to see him manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count\u2019s house. And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am crying like a silly fool, when I know it comes from my husband\u2019s great love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.\r\n\r\nThat has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement.\r\n\r\nLast night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told me to. I didn\u2019t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If I hadn\u2019t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now. She hadn\u2019t taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn\u2019t come there in the day-time with me she wouldn\u2019t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn\u2019t gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn\u2019t have destroyed her as he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning\u2014I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear\u2014the dear fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn....\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield\u2019s room, which is somewhere under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.\r\n\r\nI thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke\u2014or with the white energy of boiling water\u2014pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words \u201ca pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\u201d Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary\u2019s Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one\u2019s reason if there were too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night\u2019s sleep. Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2 October 10 p. m.\u2014Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing. In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan\u2019s manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\r\n\r\n1 October, evening.\u2014I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog\u2019s-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme\u2014let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.\r\n\r\nHe replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, guv\u2019nor, you\u2019ve treated me wery \u2019an\u2019some\u201d\u2014I had given him half a sovereign\u2014\u201can\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the \u2019Are an\u2019 \u2019Ounds, in Pincher\u2019s Alley, as \u2019ow he an\u2019 his mate \u2019ad \u2019ad a rare dusty job in a old \u2019ouse at Purfect. There ain\u2019t a-many such jobs as this \u2019ere, an\u2019 I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.\u201d I asked if he could tell me where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLook \u2019ere, guv\u2019nor, there ain\u2019t no sense in me a-keepin\u2019 you \u2019ere. I may find Sam soon, or I mayn\u2019t; but anyhow he ain\u2019t like to be in a way to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I\u2019ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But ye\u2019d better be up arter \u2019im soon in the mornin\u2019, or maybe ye won\u2019t ketch \u2019im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home. We\u2019re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I\u2019ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2 October, evening.\u2014A long and trying and exciting day. By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter\u2019s pencil in a sprawling hand:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite.\u201d\r\n\r\nI got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her, but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter\u2019s Court. Mr. Smollet\u2019s spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter\u2019s Court instead of Potter\u2019s Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran\u2019s lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the \u201cdepite,\u201d he shook his head, and said: \u201cI dunno \u2019im. There ain\u2019t no such a person \u2019ere; I never \u2019eard of \u2019im in all my bloomin\u2019 days. Don\u2019t believe there ain\u2019t nobody of that kind livin\u2019 ere or anywheres.\u201d I took out Smollet\u2019s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the depity,\u201d he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the deputy\u2019s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran\u2019s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o\u2019clock that morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a \u201cnew-fangled ware\u2019us\u201d; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve o\u2019clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new \u201ccold storage\u201d building; and as this suited the condition of a \u201cnew-fangled ware\u2019us,\u201d I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day\u2019s wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes\u2014\u201cmain heavy ones\u201d\u2014with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, guv\u2019nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a dusty old \u2019ouse, too, though nothin\u2019 to the dustiness of the \u2019ouse we tooked the bloomin\u2019 boxes from.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get into the houses if they were both empty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was the old party what engaged me a-waitin\u2019 in the \u2019ouse at Purfleet. He \u2019elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an\u2019 him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn\u2019t throw a shadder.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, \u2019e took up \u2019is end o\u2019 the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a-puffin\u2019 an\u2019 a-blowin\u2019 afore I could up-end mine anyhow\u2014an\u2019 I\u2019m no chicken, neither.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get into the house in Piccadilly?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was there too. He must \u2019a\u2019 started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an\u2019 opened the door \u2019isself an\u2019 \u2019elped me to carry the boxes into the \u2019all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole nine?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYus; there was five in the first load an\u2019 four in the second. It was main dry work, an\u2019 I don\u2019t so well remember \u2019ow I got \u2019ome.\u201d I interrupted him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWere the boxes left in the hall?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYus; it was a big \u2019all, an\u2019 there was nothin\u2019 else in it.\u201d I made one more attempt to further matters:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any key?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door \u2019isself an\u2019 shut it again when I druv off. I don\u2019t remember the last time\u2014but that was the beer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t remember the number of the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. But ye needn\u2019t have no difficulty about that. It\u2019s a \u2019igh \u2019un with a stone front with a bow on it, an\u2019 \u2019igh steps up to the door. I know them steps, \u2019avin\u2019 \u2019ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin\u2019s, an\u2019 they seein\u2019 they got so much, they wanted more; but \u2019e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw \u2019im down the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin\u2019.\u201d I thought that with this description I could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.\r\n\r\nThere was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldn\u2019t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of \u201cFor Sale\u201d up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the Piccadilly house\u2014which throughout our interview he called a \u201cmansion\u201d\u2014was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is sold, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d I said, with equal politeness, \u201cbut I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. \u201cIt is sold, sir,\u201d was again his laconic reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely,\u201d I said, \u201cyou do not mind letting me know so much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I do mind,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\u201d This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYour clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence. I am myself a professional man.\u201d Here I handed him my card. \u201cIn this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale.\u201d These words put a different complexion on affairs. He said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship\u2019s address I will consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his lordship by to-night\u2019s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward\u2019s and came away. It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the A\u00ebrated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train.\r\n\r\nI found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her.\r\n\r\nI could not tell the others of the day\u2019s discovery till we were alone; so after dinner\u2014followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves\u2014I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has been a great day\u2019s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real death.\u201d We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSay! how are we going to get into that house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got into the other,\u201d answered Lord Godalming quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don\u2019t see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning.\u201d Lord Godalming\u2019s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cQuincey\u2019s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand\u2014unless we can find the Count\u2019s key basket.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell\u2019s, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\r\n\r\nJust a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n1 October.\u2014I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny. He was, in fact, commanding destiny\u2014subjectively. He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the flies these times?\u201d He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way\u2014such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio\u2014as he answered me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical of the a\u00ebrial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly!\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\u201d His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\u201d Here he brightened up; \u201cI am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study zo\u00f6phagy!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you command life; you are a god, I suppose?\u201d He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually!\u201d This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall Enoch\u2019s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why with Enoch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he walked with God.\u201d I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t care about life and you don\u2019t want souls. Why not?\u201d I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him. The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t use them if I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn\u2019t eat them or\u2014\u2014\u201d He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. \u201cAnd doctor, as to life, what is it after all? When you\u2019ve got all you require, and you know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends\u2014good friends\u2014like you, Dr. Seward\u201d; this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning. \u201cI know that I shall never lack the means of life!\u201d\r\n\r\nI think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he\u2014a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.\r\n\r\nLater in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone.\r\n\r\nI found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about souls?\u201d It was evident then that my surmise had been correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. \u201cWhat about them yourself?\u201d I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any souls!\u201d he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it\u2014to \u201cbe cruel only to be kind.\u201d So I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou like life, and you want life?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes! but that is all right; you needn\u2019t worry about that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I asked, \u201chow are we to get the life without getting the soul also?\u201d This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cA nice time you\u2019ll have some time when you\u2019re flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you. You\u2019ve got their lives, you know, and you must put up with their souls!\u201d Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child\u2014only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like some sugar to get your flies round again?\u201d He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNot much! flies are poor things, after all!\u201d After a pause he added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr spiders?\u201d I went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlow spiders! What\u2019s the use of spiders? There isn\u2019t anything in them to eat or\u201d\u2014he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden topic.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo, so!\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cthis is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word \u2018drink\u2019; what does it mean?\u201d Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from it:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t take any stock at all in such matters. \u2018Rats and mice and such small deer,\u2019 as Shakespeare has it, \u2018chicken-feed of the larder\u2019 they might be called. I\u2019m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said. \u201cYou want big things that you can make your teeth meet in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat ridiculous nonsense you are talking!\u201d He was getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard. \u201cI wonder,\u201d I said reflectively, \u201cwhat an elephant\u2019s soul is like!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse and became a child again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want an elephant\u2019s soul, or any soul at all!\u201d he said. For a few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. \u201cTo hell with you and your souls!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhy do you plague me about souls? Haven\u2019t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already, without thinking of souls!\u201d He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cForgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am sure you will understand!\u201d He had evidently self-control; so when the attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable dignity and sweetness:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!\u201d I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in this man\u2019s state. Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls \u201ca story,\u201d if one could only get them in proper order. Here they are:\u2014\r\n\r\nWill not mention \u201cdrinking.\u201d\r\n\r\nFears the thought of being burdened with the \u201csoul\u201d of anything.\r\n\r\nHas no dread of wanting \u201clife\u201d in the future.\r\n\r\nDespises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being haunted by their souls.\r\n\r\nLogically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence\u2014the burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!\r\n\r\nAnd the assurance\u2014?\r\n\r\nMerciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of terror afoot!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come away as ignorant as we went in.\r\n\r\nHis is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.\r\n\r\nLetter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming.\r\n\r\n\u201c1 October.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Lord,\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes \u2018over the counter,\u2019 if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are, my Lord,\r\n\u201cYour Lordship\u2019s humble servants,\r\n\u201cMitchell, Sons & Candy.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n2 October.\u2014I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield\u2019s room, and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study\u2014Mrs. Harker having gone to bed\u2014we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient\u2019s room and looked in through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration.\r\n\r\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having \u201cdozed\u201d for a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched.\r\n\r\nTo-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later.\r\n\r\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if Renfield\u2019s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?\u2014\u2014 That wild yell seemed to come from his room....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had somehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood. I must go at once....\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\r\n\r\n3 October.\u2014Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to Renfield\u2019s room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries; there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor\u2014indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed.\u201d How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink. But for the life of me I can\u2019t imagine how the two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn\u2019t beat his head; and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it.\u201d I said to him:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant\u2019s delay.\u201d The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself. If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSend the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the operation.\u201d So I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient. The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor thought a moment and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late.\u201d As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times. I\u2019ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as they have been. We\u2019ll have to look back\u2014and forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?\u201d I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\u201d I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation\u2014for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched in patience.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall wait,\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cjust long enough to fix the best spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot; for it is evident that the h\u00e6morrhage is increasing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing\u2019s face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death-watch. The poor man\u2019s breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake! We shall operate just above the ear.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout another word he made the operation. For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move. What\u2019s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully.\u201d He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cTell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\u201d As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\u201d\u2014he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey\u2014\u201cThe brandy\u2014it is in my study\u2014quick!\u201d He flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\u201d Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I were not sure already, I would know from them.\u201d For an instant his eyes closed\u2014not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes; and then I must go back to death\u2014or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn\u2019t speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\u201d As he spoke, Van Helsing\u2019s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: \u201cGo on,\u201d in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before; but he was solid then\u2014not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a man\u2019s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn\u2019t ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to\u2014just as he had wanted all along. Then he began promising me things\u2014not in words but by doing them.\u201d He was interrupted by a word from the Professor:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs.\u201d Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges\u2014what you call the \u2018Death\u2019s-head Moth\u2019?\u201d The patient went on without stopping.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he began to whisper: \u2018Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely buzzing flies!\u2019 I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do. Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red\u2014like His, only smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying: \u2018All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!\u2019 And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him: \u2018Come in, Lord and Master!\u2019 The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide\u2014just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \u201cLet him go on. Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought.\u201d He proceeded:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAll day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him. When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn\u2019t even smell the same as he went by me. I couldn\u2019t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the room.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better. They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn\u2019t the same; it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\u201d Here we all moved, but no one said a word; he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn\u2019t look the same. I don\u2019t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn\u2019t think of it at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her.\u201d I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \u201cSo when He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and as I knew I was a madman\u2014at times anyhow\u2014I resolved to use my power. Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn\u2019t mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door.\u201d His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe know the worst now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is here, and we know his purpose. It may not be too late. Let us be armed\u2014the same as we were the other night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.\u201d There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words\u2014we shared them in common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count\u2019s house. The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThey never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with. Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!\u201d He stopped; his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.\r\n\r\nOutside the Harkers\u2019 door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the latter said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cShould we disturb her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must,\u201d said Van Helsing grimly. \u201cIf the door be locked, I shall break it in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady\u2019s room!\u201d\r\n\r\nVan Helsing said solemnly, \u201cYou are always right; but this is life and death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends. Now!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the Count\u2014in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker\u2019s hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man\u2019s bare breast which was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten\u2019s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey\u2019s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count\u2019s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cJonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself; I must wake him!\u201d He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant I heard Harker\u2019s quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn God\u2019s name what does this mean?\u201d Harker cried out. \u201cDr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear, what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to this!\u201d and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together. \u201cGood God help us! help her! oh, help her!\u201d With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,\u2014all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \u201cWhat has happened? Tell me all about it!\u201d he cried without pausing. \u201cDr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too far yet. Guard her while I look for him!\u201d His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\u201d Her expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm and take counsel together.\u201d She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband\u2019s breast. When she raised it, his white night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cUnclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear.\u201d To this he spoke out resolutely:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\u201d He put out his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad fact; tell me all that has been.\u201d I told him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door. They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had, however\u2014\u2014\u201d He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now is in knowing all. Tell freely!\u201d So Art went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames.\u201d Here I interrupted. \u201cThank God there is the other copy in the safe!\u201d His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on: \u201cI ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked into Renfield\u2019s room; but there was no trace there except\u2014\u2014!\u201d Again he paused. \u201cGo on,\u201d said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added: \u201cexcept that the poor fellow is dead.\u201d Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGod\u2019s will be done!\u201d I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt may be much eventually, but at present I can\u2019t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from Renfield\u2019s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker\u2019s head:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, Madam Mina\u2014poor, dear, dear Madam Mina\u2014tell us exactly what happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and learn.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly. After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind\u2014all of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\u201d Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly: \u201cDo not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist\u2014or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared\u2014stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary\u2019s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.\u2019 I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, \u2018First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!\u2019 I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\u201d Her husband groaned again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with the fresh blood!\u201d The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband\u2019s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he spoke to me mockingly, \u2018And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they played wits against me\u2014against me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were born\u2014I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my call. When my brain says \u201cCome!\u201d to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding; and to that end this!\u2019 With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the\u2014\u2014 Oh my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril; and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!\u201d Then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.\r\n\r\nAs she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken, and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet; but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair.\r\n\r\nWe have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.\r\n\r\nOf this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\r\n\r\n3 October.\u2014As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It is now six o\u2019clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However, we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested\u2014that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down\u2014he confessed to half dozing\u2014when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out loudly several times, \u201cGod! God! God!\u201d after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard \u201cvoices\u201d or \u201ca voice,\u201d and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word \u201cGod\u201d was spoken by the patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought that on the attendant\u2019s evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result.\r\n\r\nWhen the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full confidence; that nothing of any sort\u2014no matter how painful\u2014should be kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair. \u201cThere must be no concealment,\u201d she said, \u201cAlas! we have had too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured\u2014than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!\u201d Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?\u201d Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh no! for my mind is made up!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo what?\u201d he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause if I find in myself\u2014and I shall watch keenly for it\u2014a sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would not kill yourself?\u201d he asked, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!\u201d She looked at him meaningly as she spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my child\u2014\u2014\u201d For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat; he gulped it down and went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you do not die\u2014nay, nor think of death\u2014till this great evil be past.\u201d The poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may have passed away from me.\u201d She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before. She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do\u2014if \u201cpleased\u201d could be used in connection with so grim an interest.\r\n\r\nAs usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is perhaps well,\u201d he said, \u201cthat at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours; and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\u201d Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina\u2019s life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly. \u201cNay, friend Jonathan,\u201d he said, \u201cin this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly. The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt \u2018stop the earths\u2019 and so we run down our old fox\u2014so? is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us come at once,\u201d I cried, \u201cwe are wasting the precious, precious time!\u201d The Professor did not move, but simply said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny way!\u201d I cried. \u201cWe shall break in if need be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?\u201d I nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the lock for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your police, they would interfere, would they not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, \u201call that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever\u2014oh, so clever!\u2014in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done en r\u00e8gle; and in our work we shall be en r\u00e8gle too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o\u2019clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina\u2019s face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van Helsing went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth-boxes\u2014at Bermondsey and Mile End.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Godalming stood up. \u201cI can be of some use here,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, old fellow,\u201d said Morris, \u201cit is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don\u2019t you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes? It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend Quincey is right!\u201d said the Professor. \u201cHis head is what you call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.\u201d\r\n\r\nMina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale\u2014almost ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Count\u2019s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us some new clue.\r\n\r\nAs to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly; that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them. It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count\u2019s papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count\u2019s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina\u2019s resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together. \u201cAs for me,\u201d she said, \u201cI have no fear. Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.\u201d So I started up crying out: \u201cThen in God\u2019s name let us come at once, for we are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so!\u201d said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you forget,\u201d he said, with actually a smile, \u201cthat last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?\u201d\r\n\r\nDid I forget! shall I ever\u2014can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. \u201cOh, Madam Mina,\u201d he said, \u201cdear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will forget it, will you not?\u201d He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong.\u201d\r\n\r\nBreakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy\u2019s lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?\u201d We all assured him. \u201cThen it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset; and before then we shall return\u2014if\u2014\u2014 We shall return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina\u2019s forehead, it had seared it\u2014had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor darling\u2019s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cUnclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.\u201d They all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God\u2019s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man\u2019s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.\r\n\r\nIt was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.\r\n\r\nTo one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.\r\n\r\nWe entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God.\u201d As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.\r\n\r\nOne by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion of the Host.\r\n\r\nWhen we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam Mina\u2019s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform.\r\n\r\nI have written this in the train.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPiccadilly, 12:30 o\u2019clock.\u2014Just before we reached Fenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cQuincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it wouldn\u2019t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better.\u201d I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on: \u201cBesides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe advice is good!\u201d said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others.\r\n\r\nAt length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done. The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing\u2019s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.\r\n\r\nWhen the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe place smells so vilely,\u201d said the latter as we came in. It did indeed smell vilely\u2014like the old chapel at Carfax\u2014and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.\r\n\r\nAfter a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey; note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin\u2014the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return\u2014or the coming of the Count.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\r\n\r\n3 October.\u2014The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker. The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see. Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his\u2014\u2014! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as I can remember, here it is:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and alchemist\u2014which latter was the highest development of the science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man\u2019s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet\u2014he may be yet if we fail\u2014the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life.\u201d\r\n\r\nHarker groaned and said, \u201cAnd this is all arrayed against my darling! But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow. Festina lente may well be his motto.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fail to understand,\u201d said Harker wearily. \u201cOh, do be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been making use of the zo\u00f6phagous patient to effect his entry into friend John\u2019s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him; and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are five of us when those absent ones return.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postman\u2019s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want to see you: Mina.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker\u2019s voice:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!\u201d Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGod will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI care for nothing now,\u201d he answered hotly, \u201cexcept to wipe out this brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, hush, hush, my child!\u201d said Van Helsing. \u201cGod does not purchase souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man, and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive here\u2014see, it is twenty minutes past one\u2014and there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker\u2019s telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor\u2019s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various armaments\u2014the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we destroyed them all!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDestroyed?\u201d asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor him!\u201d We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn\u2019t turn up by five o\u2019clock, we must start off; for it won\u2019t do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe will be here before long now,\u201d said Van Helsing, who had been consulting his pocket-book. \u201cNota bene, in Madam\u2019s telegram he went south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one o\u2019clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your arms! Be ready!\u201d He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.\r\n\r\nI could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise\u2014at least he feared it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something so panther-like in the movement\u2014something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count\u2019s leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out. The expression of the Count\u2019s face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity\u2014of anger and hellish rage\u2014which came over the Count\u2019s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker\u2019s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the \u201cting\u201d of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.\r\n\r\nWe ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There he turned and spoke to us:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think to baffle me, you\u2014with your pale faces all in a row, like sheep in a butcher\u2019s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and others shall yet be mine\u2014my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed. Bah!\u201d With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have learnt something\u2014much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he return.\u201d As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with a match.\r\n\r\nGodalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however, bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us go back to Madam Mina\u2014poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find it; when that is done all may yet be well.\u201d I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress\u2014he was thinking of his wife.\r\n\r\nWith sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!\u201d As she spoke, she took her husband\u2019s grey head in her hands and kissed it\u2014\u201cLay your poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect us if He so will it in His good intent.\u201d The poor fellow groaned. There was no place for words in his sublime misery.\r\n\r\nWe had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people\u2014for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast\u2014or the sense of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to her husband\u2019s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present time. Then without letting go her husband\u2019s hand she stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth\u2014remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God.\r\n\r\n\u201cJonathan,\u201d she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness, \u201cJonathan dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time. I know that you must fight\u2014that you must destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter; but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his destruction.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke I could see her husband\u2019s face darken and draw together, as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core. Instinctively the clasp on his wife\u2019s hand grew closer, till his knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMay God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don\u2019t say such things, Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just think, my dear\u2014I have been thinking all this long, long day of it\u2014that ... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some other like you\u2014and with equal cause for anger\u2014may deny it to me! Oh, my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed. Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God.\r\n\r\nBefore they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace. She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her husband\u2019s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was, I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency. When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in, for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n3-4 October, close to midnight.\u2014I thought yesterday would never end. There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the meantime!\u2014the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now. This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary\u2014weary to death. However, I must try to sleep; for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me until....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily, for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! there is someone in the corridor!\u201d I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door.\r\n\r\nJust outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all night. We don\u2019t mean to take any chances!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thank God for good brave men!\u201d With a sigh she sank back again to sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4 October, morning.\u2014Once again during the night I was wakened by Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cGo, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.\u201d I went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing me, he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d he asked, in alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I replied; \u201cbut Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go,\u201d he said, and hurried into the Professor\u2019s room.\r\n\r\nIn two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile\u2014a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!\u201d Then turning to her, he said, cheerfully: \u201cAnd what am I do for you? For at this hour you do not want me for nothings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you to hypnotise me!\u201d she said. \u201cDo it before the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is short!\u201d Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.\r\n\r\nLooking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her, from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in. They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The stillness was broken by Van Helsing\u2019s voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d The answer came in a neutral way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.\u201d For several minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina\u2019s face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know. It is all strange to me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see nothing; it is all dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you hear?\u201d I could detect the strain in the Professor\u2019s patient voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can hear them on the outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you are on a ship?\u201d We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came quick:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else do you hear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am still\u2014oh, so still. It is like death!\u201d The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina\u2019s shoulders, and laid her head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her. \u201cHave I been talking in my sleep?\u201d was all she said. She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!\u201d Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor\u2019s calm voice called them back:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cStay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men, since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the Count\u2019s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan\u2019s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would\u2014unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need, and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us.\u201d Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?\u201d He took her hand and patted it as he replied:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAsk me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all questions.\u201d He would say no more, and we separated to dress.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!\u201d She grew paler as she asked faintly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he answered solemnly, \u201che can live for centuries, and you are but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded\u2014since once he put that mark upon your throat.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING\r\n\r\nTHIS to Jonathan Harker.\r\n\r\nYou are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our search\u2014if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day. This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already, for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him. But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last resource\u2014his last earth-work I might say did I wish double entente. He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came, and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound; when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do. But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is but begun, and in the end we shall win\u2014so sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.\r\n\r\nVan Helsing.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n4 October.\u2014When I read to Mina, Van Helsing\u2019s message in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort; and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nAlas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling\u2019s white forehead. Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting. Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others after their investigations.\r\n\r\nThe day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run for me again. It is now three o\u2019clock.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n5 October, 5 p. m.\u2014Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.\r\n\r\nDr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd\u2019s, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go out with the tide. She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle\u2019s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube. \u2018Soh!\u2019 said I, \u2018this is the ship whereon is the Count.\u2019 So off we go to Doolittle\u2019s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five o\u2019clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be. But he say \u2018no\u2019; that he come not yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick\u2014with blood\u2014for that his ship will leave the place\u2014of blood\u2014before the turn of the tide\u2014with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn\u2019t want no Frenchmen\u2014with bloom upon them and also with blood\u2014in his ship\u2014with blood on her also. And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one knew where he went \u2018or bloomin\u2019 well cared,\u2019 as they said, for they had something else to think of\u2014well with blood again; for it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The captain swore polyglot\u2014very polyglot\u2014polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box\u2014old and with much bloom and blood\u2014were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him. Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain\u2019s swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say \u2018no\u2019; for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own way.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: \u201cWe have the best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning.\u201d I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion, at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is necessary\u2014necessary\u2014necessary! For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land\u2014barren of peoples\u2014and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have infect you\u2014oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live\u2014to live in your own old, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is of man\u2019s common lot and with God\u2019s sanction, shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God\u2019s own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause.\u201d He paused and I said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d he said, \u201cyour simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again. Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love\u2014for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall decide on some definite cause of action.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nI feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...\r\n\r\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still unclean.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n5 October.\u2014We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again.\r\n\r\nIt is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way\u2014even by death\u2014and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker\u2019s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker\u2019s tongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called \u201cthe Vampire\u2019s baptism of blood.\u201d Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker\u2019s silences, then there is a terrible difficulty\u2014an unknown danger\u2014in the work before us. The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!\r\n\r\nVan Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall try to open the subject with him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said suddenly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence\u201d; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMadam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.\u201d A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing continued:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWith the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?\u201d I nodded acquiescence; he went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be. When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by us.\u201d He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I expected.\r\n\r\nIt is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days. Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship\u2019s voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed\u2014armed against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.\u201d Here Quincey Morris added:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn\u2019t we have given then for a repeater apiece!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cWinchesters it shall be. Quincey\u2019s head is level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there. To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe four?\u201d said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d answered the Professor quickly, \u201cyou must remain to take care of your so sweet wife!\u201d Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with Mina.\u201d I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n5 October, afternoon.\u2014For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina\u2019s determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina\u2019s happy sleep, and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cJonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A promise made to me, but made holily in God\u2019s hearing, and not to be broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMina,\u201d I said, \u201ca promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have no right to make it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, dear one,\u201d she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars, \u201cit is I who wish it; and it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved from the promise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise!\u201d I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead. She said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cPromise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!\u201d and she solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise!\u201d and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater, midnight.\u2014Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening. So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care. Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6 October, morning.\u2014Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said quite simply, \u201cit will not be necessary. You can tell them just as well. I must go with you on your journey.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment\u2019s pause he asked:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any of us from\u2014from circumstances\u2014things that have been.\u201d He paused, embarrassed.\r\n\r\nAs she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by wile; by any device to hoodwink\u2014even Jonathan.\u201d God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears. She went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even I myself do not know.\u201d Dr. Van Helsing said very gravely:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMadam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.\u201d When he had spoken, Mina\u2019s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also. He told them what Mina had said, and went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do exactly?\u201d asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor paused before replying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was man\u2019s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and\u2014and all will be well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall not wait for any opportunity,\u201d said Morris. \u201cWhen I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!\u201d I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel. I think he understood my look; I hope he did.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Dr. Van Helsing. \u201cBrave boy. Quincey is all man. God bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do\u2014what we must do. But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder.\r\n\r\nIt is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina\u2019s uneasiness calls my attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger\u2014some new pain, which, however, may in God\u2019s will be means to a good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they shall be ready.\r\n\r\nShe is calling to me.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\r\n\r\n11 October, Evening.\u2014Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.\r\n\r\nI think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom; when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.\r\n\r\nTo-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband\u2019s hand in hers began:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know, dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.\u201d This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. \u201cIn the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost\u2014no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake\u2014you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are. There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!\u201d She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that way?\u201d asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. \u201cWhat is that way, which we must not\u2014may not\u2014take?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy\u2019s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God\u2019s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!\u201d We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set and Harker\u2019s grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is what I can give into the hotch-pot.\u201d I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all seriousness. \u201cWhat will each of you give? Your lives I know,\u201d she went on quickly, \u201cthat is easy for brave men. Your lives are God\u2019s, and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?\u201d She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband\u2019s face. Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. \u201cThen I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all\u2014even you, my beloved husband\u2014that, should the time come, you will kill me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that time?\u201d The voice was Quincey\u2019s, but it was low and strained.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment\u2019s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head; or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!\u201d\r\n\r\nQuincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only a rough fellow, who hasn\u2019t, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy true friend!\u201d was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as, bending over, she kissed his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!\u201d said Van Helsing.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I!\u201d said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou too, my dearest,\u201d she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes. \u201cYou must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men\u2019s duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy\u2019s case to him who loved\u201d\u2014she stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase\u2014\u201cto him who had best right to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband\u2019s life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAgain I swear!\u201d came the Professor\u2019s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget: this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a time I myself might be\u2014nay! if the time ever comes, shall be\u2014leagued with your enemy against you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more request;\u201d she became very solemn as she said this, \u201cit is not vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for me, if you will.\u201d We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need to speak:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you to read the Burial Service.\u201d She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and continued: \u201cYou must read it over me some day. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever\u2014come what may!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut oh, my dear one,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cdeath is afar off from you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d she said, holding up a warning hand. \u201cI am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my wife, must I read it?\u201d he said, before he began.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would comfort me, my husband!\u201d was all she said; and he began to read when she had got the book ready.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I\u2014how could any one\u2014tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband\u2019s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead. I\u2014I cannot go on\u2014words\u2014and\u2014v-voice\u2014f-fail m-me!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShe was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker\u2019s coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n15 October, Varna.\u2014We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o\u2019clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel\u2014\u201cthe Odessus.\u201d The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the Czarina Catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world. Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing; all is dark.\u201d And to the second:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is high\u2014I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.\u201d It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd\u2019s from anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.\r\n\r\nWe had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man\u2019s form without suspicion\u2014which he evidently wishes to avoid\u2014he must remain in the box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n16 October.\u2014Mina\u2019s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and when we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready. As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n17 October.\u2014Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming\u2019s kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count\u2019s body, it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the Czarina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n24 October.\u2014A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story: \u201cNot yet reported.\u201d Mina\u2019s morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.\r\n\r\nTelegram, October 24th.\r\n\r\nRufus Smith, Lloyd\u2019s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.\r\nVice-Consul, Varna.\r\n\r\n\u201cCzarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n25 October.\u2014How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd\u2019s. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It would break poor Harker\u2019s heart\u2014certainly his nerve\u2014if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should neither of us shrink from the task\u2014awful though it be to contemplate. \u201cEuthanasia\u201d is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.\r\n\r\nIt is only about 24 hours\u2019 sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London. She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one o\u2019clock, so as to be ready.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n25 October, Noon.\u2014No news yet of the ship\u2019s arrival. Mrs. Harker\u2019s hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that \u201cKukri\u201d ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!\r\n\r\nVan Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To his doom, I trust!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n26 October.\u2014Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine. She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs. Harker\u2019s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog; some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n27 October, Noon.\u2014Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for. Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: \u201clapping waves and rushing water,\u201d though she added that \u201cthe waves were very faint.\u201d The telegrams from London have been the same: \u201cno further report.\u201d Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina\u2019s. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance.\u201d I was about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n28 October.\u2014Telegram. Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming, care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna.\r\n\r\n\u201cCzarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one o\u2019clock to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n28 October.\u2014When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen. The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o\u2019-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our old wandering days it meant \u201caction.\u201d Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled\u2014actually smiled\u2014the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. \u201cWhen does the next train start for Galatz?\u201d said Van Helsing to us generally.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt 6:30 to-morrow morning!\u201d We all started, for the answer came from Mrs. Harker.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth do you know?\u201d said Art.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget\u2014or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr. Van Helsing\u2014that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWonderful woman!\u201d murmured the Professor.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t we get a special?\u201d asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his head: \u201cI fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think. Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, \u201cshall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\u201d The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the time, however.\r\n\r\nWhen the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harker\u2019s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door was shut upon her he said to me:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe mean the same! speak out!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may deceive us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d said I, \u201cunless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great\u2014a terrible\u2014risk; but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box. Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call; but he cut her off\u2014take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance! She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great brain which is trained like man\u2019s brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether\u2014though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend John, to you with so much of experience already\u2014and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young\u2014here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the \u201cUgly Duck\u201d of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I read here what Jonathan have written:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThat other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count\u2019s child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean\u2014what it might mean. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature\u2019s course they move on their way and they touch\u2014then pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime? \u2018Yes\u2019 and \u2018No.\u2019 You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not\u2014not but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad universale. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it is. That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime\u2014that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more. \u2018Dos pou sto,\u2019 said Archimedes. \u2018Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!\u2019 To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,\u201d for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes.\u201d He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke. His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and qu\u00e2 criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know\u2014and that from his own lips\u2014tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a \u2018tight place,\u2019 he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won. So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood, good! oh, you so clever lady!\u201d said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room consultation:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSeventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.\u201d Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid; John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends.\u201d The Professor stood up:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us. But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in God\u2019s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his; and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nDR. SEWARD\u2019S DIARY\r\n\r\n29 October.\u2014This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear men\u2019s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away. There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air blowing upon me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding. Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker\u2019s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWould none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!\u201d We could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, my friends. He is close to land: he has left his earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him. We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn; at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.\r\n\r\nEarly this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made reply:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAll is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood.\u201d She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till to-night.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning; but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count\u2019s sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count\u2019s power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did speak, her words were enigmatical:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can hear, far off, confused sounds\u2014as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.\u201d She stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even in answer to the Professor\u2019s imperative questioning. When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said; when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n30 October, 7 a. m.\u2014We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAll is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a queer one like\u2014\u2014\u201d She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on; go on! Speak, I command you!\u201d said Van Helsing in an agonised voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker\u2019s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can\u2019t? I don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!\u2019 It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Madam Mina,\u201d he said, sadly, \u201cit is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n30 October.\u2014Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk. He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n30 October.\u2014At nine o\u2019clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming\u2019s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run.\r\n\r\n\u201cMan!\u201d he said, \u201cbut it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi\u2019 some rare piece o\u2019 ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It\u2019s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi\u2019 a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin\u2019 on yer sail for his ain purpose. An\u2019 a\u2019 the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi\u2019 us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi\u2019oot bein\u2019 able to signal; an\u2019 till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o\u2019 aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi\u2019 the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an\u2019 the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin\u2019 him.\u201d This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cMine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match!\u201d The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o\u2019 them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin\u2019 old man just before we had started frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn\u2019t say it was agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn\u2019t let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres\u2014well, he would fetch it up a\u2019reet. An\u2019 if he didn\u2019t, well, we\u2019d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin\u2019 sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi\u2019 them aboot it wi\u2019 a handspike; an\u2019 when the last o\u2019 them rose off the deck wi\u2019 his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I\u2019d let it lie till we discharged in the port an\u2019 get rid o\u2019t althegither. We didn\u2019t do much clearin\u2019 that day, an\u2019 had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin\u2019, braw an\u2019 airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi\u2019 an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a\u2019 reet, an\u2019 glad I was to be rid o\u2019 the dam\u2019 thing, for I was beginnin\u2019 masel\u2019 to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 it was nane ither than that same!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was the name of the man who took it?\u201d asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be tellin\u2019 ye quick!\u201d he answered, and, stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed \u201cImmanuel Hildesheim.\u201d Burgen-strasse 16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so with thanks we came away.\r\n\r\nWe found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were pointed with specie\u2014we doing the punctuation\u2014and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine. This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all he knew.\r\n\r\nWe then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten and eleven o\u2019clock last night. We were at a standstill again.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out \u201cThis is the work of a Slovak!\u201d We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.\r\n\r\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.\r\n\r\nWhen we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n30 October, evening.\u2014They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the \u201cTraveller\u2019s\u201d typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write with a pen....\r\n\r\nIt is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh! if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.\r\n\r\nI have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to follow the Professor\u2019s example, and think without prejudice on the facts before me....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI do believe that under God\u2019s providence I have made a discovery. I shall get the maps and look over them....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so I shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Memorandum.\r\n\r\n(Entered in her Journal.)\r\n\r\nGround of inquiry.\u2014Count Dracula\u2019s problem is to get back to his own place.\r\n\r\n(a) He must be brought back by some one. This is evident; for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be\u2014confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.\r\n\r\n(b) How is he to be taken?\u2014Here a process of exclusions may help us. By road, by rail, by water?\r\n\r\n1. By Road.\u2014There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city.\r\n\r\n(x) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.\r\n\r\n(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.\r\n\r\n(z) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even his victim\u2014me!\r\n\r\n2. By Rail.\u2014There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.\r\n\r\n3. By Water.\u2014Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.\r\n\r\nWe know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do is to ascertain what water.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may, then, get a light on what his later task is to be.\r\n\r\nFirstly.\u2014We must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.\r\n\r\nSecondly we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.\r\n\r\nThat, so far, his plans were successful we know. The Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journey\u2014so much so that Captain Donelson\u2019s suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness played the Count\u2019s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the Count\u2019s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it\u2014and here we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.\r\n\r\nNow we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival\u2014on land, at Galatz.\r\n\r\nThe box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work? In my husband\u2019s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man\u2019s remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.\r\n\r\nMy surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.\r\n\r\nI have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat\u2014propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down stream.\r\n\r\nOf course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula\u2019s castle as can be got by water.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal\u2014continued.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOur dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men, to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all shall do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall get a steam launch and follow him,\u201d said Lord Godalming.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,\u201d said Mr. Morris.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d said the Professor, \u201cboth good. But neither must go alone. There must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms.\u201d All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.\u201d Dr. Seward said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust\u2014for I don\u2019t suppose these fellows carry guns\u2014would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we shall not rest until the Count\u2019s head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.\u201d He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ... the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFriend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him\u2014that\u2014which has wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy\u2019s country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land\u2014where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish\u2014we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,\u2014from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam Mina\u2019s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way\u2014all dark and unknown otherwise\u2014after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.\u201d Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil\u2019s illness, right into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or Hell!\u201d He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy\u2014with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo? Have you felt the Vampire\u2019s lips upon your throat?\u201d Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry: \u201cOh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!\u201d and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor\u2019s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that place. There is work\u2014wild work\u2014to be done there, that her eyes may not see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time\u2014and he is strong and subtle and cunning\u2014he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one\u201d\u2014he took my hand\u2014\u201cwould come to him to keep him company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving, possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I who would have to go to keep them company.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo as you will,\u201d said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, \u201cwe are in the hands of God!\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment\u2019s notice. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly; his look is a warning. There must be no tears now\u2014unless it may be that God will let them fall in gladness.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\nOctober 30. Night.\u2014I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina\u2019s guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count\u2019s escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch. But I cannot sleep\u2014how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses\u2014four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.\r\n\r\nIt is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnace door....\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n31 October.\u2014Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and prayed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1 November, evening.\u2014No news all day; we have found nothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2 November, morning.\u2014It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large\u2014at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts\u2014the horsemen may not have met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n2 November.\u2014Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully. Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on; we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3 November.\u2014We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza. I wish it wasn\u2019t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4 November.\u2014To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n31 October.\u2014Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I could say was: \u201cdark and quiet.\u201d He is off now buying a carriage and horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint people! But, alas!\u2014\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLater.\u2014Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of our being cold.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\nWe shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nMINA HARKER\u2019S JOURNAL\r\n\r\n1 November.\u2014All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities. They are very, very superstitious. In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can\u2019t abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual \u201cdarkness, lapping water and creaking wood\u201d; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror\u2019s; even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us, and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2 November, morning.\u2014I was successful, and we took turns driving all night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange heaviness in the air\u2014I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered \u201cdarkness, creaking wood and roaring water,\u201d so the river is changing as they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger\u2014more than need be; but we are in God\u2019s hands.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2 November, night.\u2014All day long driving. The country gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath.\r\n\r\nMemorandum by Abraham Van Helsing.\r\n\r\n4 November.\u2014This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive\u2014Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well. However, to-night she is more vif. Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well, God\u2019s will be done\u2014whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!\r\n\r\nNow to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded.\r\n\r\nWe got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As before, came the answer: \u201cdarkness and the swirling of water.\u201d Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass. At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow know you it?\u201d I ask.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I know it,\u201d she answer, and with a pause, add: \u201cHave not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?\u201d\r\n\r\nAt first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use.\r\n\r\nSo we came down this road; when we meet other ways\u2014not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen\u2014the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world.\r\n\r\nThen I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down. Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Count\u2019s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already\u2014that she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!\u2014I am afraid of all things\u2014even to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5 November, morning.\u2014Let me be accurate in everything, for though you and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad\u2014that the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.\r\n\r\nAll yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her\u2014even for food. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. \u201cWell,\u201d said I to myself, \u201cif it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night.\u201d As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill, the end was near.\r\n\r\nI woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us\u2014for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight\u2014I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the time\u2014so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you not come over to the fire?\u201d for I wished to make a test of what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not go on?\u201d I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot!\u201d and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!\r\n\r\nPresently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear\u2014horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan\u2019s horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!\u201d I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you? It is for you that I fear!\u201d whereat she laughed\u2014a laugh, low and unreal, and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am,\u201d and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till\u2014if God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes\u2014there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!\u201d In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.\r\n\r\nAnd so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.\r\n\r\nI will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her sleep....\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n4 November, evening.\u2014The accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago; and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.\r\n\r\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\r\n\r\n5 November.\u2014With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who, or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....\r\n\r\nDr. Van Helsing\u2019s Memorandum.\r\n\r\n5 November, afternoon.\u2014I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle. The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out. Jonathan\u2019s bitter experience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns.\r\n\r\nHer, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God\u2019s will. At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.\r\n\r\nI knew that there were at least three graves to find\u2014graves that are inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss\u2014and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...\r\n\r\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved\u2014I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate\u2014I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.\r\n\r\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it was but one word\r\n\r\nDRACULA.\r\n\r\nThis then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew. Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work, I laid in Dracula\u2019s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.\r\n\r\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....\r\n\r\nOh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud \u201cI am here!\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the Count enter there Un-Dead.\r\n\r\nWhen I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d she said, \u201ccome away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us.\u201d She was looking thin and pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet our friends\u2014and him\u2014whom Madam Mina tell me that she know are coming to meet us.\r\n\r\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\r\n\r\n6 November.\u2014It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula\u2019s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the drifted snow.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the hand and drew me in: \u201cSee!\u201d he said, \u201chere you will be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\u201d He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLook! Madam Mina, look! look!\u201d I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far off\u2014in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before\u2014came a group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog\u2019s tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men\u2019s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.\r\n\r\nOn the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAt least you shall be safe here from him!\u201d He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201cthey come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can.\u201d He paused and went on in a hollow voice:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God\u2019s will be done!\u201d Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cLook! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots it all out!\u201d I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan. At the same time I knew that Jonathan was not far off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter. \u201cThey are all converging,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.\u201d I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers\u2014the wolves were gathering for their prey.\r\n\r\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm\u2019s length before us; but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops.\r\n\r\nCloser and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our presence.\r\n\r\nAll at once two voices shouted out to: \u201cHalt!\u201d One was my Jonathan\u2019s, raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris\u2019 strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun\u2014now close down on the hill tops\u2014and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand. For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan\u2019s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.\r\n\r\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well.\r\n\r\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph.\r\n\r\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan\u2019s great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris\u2019s bowie knife plunged into the heart.\r\n\r\nIt was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there.\r\n\r\nThe Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun.\r\n\r\nThe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cI am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!\u201d he cried suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \u201cIt was worth for this to die! Look! look!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest \u201cAmen\u201d broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man spoke:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cNow God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nSeven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy\u2019s birthday is the same day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friend\u2019s spirit has passed into him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but we call him Quincey.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home we were talking of the old time\u2014which we could all look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing\u2019s memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her sweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.\u201d\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s More to Follow!\r\n\r\nMore stories of the sort you like; more, probably, by the author of this one; more than 500 titles all told by writers of world-wide reputation, in the Authors\u2019 Alphabetical List which you will find on the reverse side of the wrapper of this book.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\nSection 3.

The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,\u2014a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.\r\n\r\nAs Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, \u201cLet me see the child, and die.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed\u2019s head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you must not talk about dying yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLor bless her dear heart, no!\u201d interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cLor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on \u2019em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she\u2019ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there\u2019s a dear young lamb do.\u201d\r\n\r\nApparently this consolatory perspective of a mother\u2019s prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back\u2014and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!\u201d said the surgeon at last.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, poor dear, so it is!\u201d said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child. \u201cPoor dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,\u201d said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely it will be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.\u201d He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added, \u201cShe was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was brought here last night,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cby the overseer\u2019s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. \u201cThe old story,\u201d he said, shaking his head: \u201cno wedding-ring, I see. Ah! Good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\r\n\r\nWhat an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once\u2014a parish child\u2014the orphan of a workhouse\u2014the humble, half-starved drudge\u2014to be cuffed and buffeted through the world\u2014despised by all, and pitied by none.\r\n\r\nOliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTREATS OF OLIVER TWIST\u2019S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\r\n\r\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in \u201cthe house\u201d who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be \u201cfarmed,\u201d or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny\u2019s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of her system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing\u2014though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm\u2014the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when they went; and what more would the people have!\r\n\r\nIt cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist\u2019s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver\u2019s breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?\u201d said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy. \u201c(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash \u2019em directly.)\u2014My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cLor, only think,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, running out,\u2014for the three boys had been removed by this time,\u2014\u201conly think of that! That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, \u201cto keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann with great humility.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He relaxed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, Mrs. Mann,\u201d he replied in a calmer tone; \u201cit may be as you say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t you be offended at what I\u2019m a going to say,\u201d observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn\u2019t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a drop. Nor a drop,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a dignified, but placid manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you will,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. \u201cJust a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble coughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, just a leetle drop,\u201d said Mrs. Mann persuasively.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d inquired the beadle.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s what I\u2019m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants\u2019 Daffy, when they ain\u2019t well, Mr. Bumble,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. \u201cIt\u2019s gin. I\u2019ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It\u2019s gin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?\u201d inquired Bumble, following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, bless \u2019em, that I do, dear as it is,\u201d replied the nurse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see \u2019em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u201d; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; \u201cno, you could not. You are a humane woman, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (Here she set down the glass.) \u201cI shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (He drew it towards him.) \u201cYou feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (He stirred the gin-and-water.) \u201cI\u2014I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann\u201d; and he swallowed half of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now about business,\u201d said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket-book. \u201cThe child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBless him!\u201d interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat\u2019ral exertions on the part of this parish,\u201d said Bumble, \u201cwe have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his mother\u2019s settlement, name, or condition.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment\u2019s reflection, \u201cHow comes he to have any name at all, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, \u201cI inwented it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou, Mr. Bumble!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last was a S,\u2014Swubble, I named him. This was a T,\u2014Twist, I named him. The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come to Z.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re quite a literary character, sir!\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment; \u201cperhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.\u201d He finished the gin-and-water, and added, \u201cOliver being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll fetch him directly,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that purpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.\r\n\r\n\u201cMake a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\nOliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you go along with me, Oliver?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic voice.\r\n\r\nOliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the beadle\u2019s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill she go with me?\u201d inquired poor Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cBut she\u2019ll come and see you sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes. Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child\u2019s heart for the first time.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were \u201cnearly there.\u201d To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.\r\n\r\nOliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.\r\n\r\nNot having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.\r\n\r\n\u201cBow to the board,\u201d said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair.\r\n\r\nOliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry. These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool. Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoy,\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair, \u201clisten to me. You know you\u2019re an orphan, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, sir?\u201d inquired poor Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy is a fool\u2014I thought he was,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said the gentleman who had spoken first. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What could the boy be crying for?\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you say your prayers every night,\u201d said another gentleman in a gruff voice; \u201cand pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you\u2014like a Christian.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him. But he hadn\u2019t, because nobody had taught him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,\u201d said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o\u2019clock,\u201d added the surly one in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\nFor the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England! They let the paupers go to sleep!\r\n\r\nPoor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it:\r\n\r\nThe members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered\u2014the poor people liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. \u201cOho!\u201d said the board, looking very knowing; \u201cwe are the fellows to set this to rights; we\u2019ll stop it all, in no time.\u201d So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays. They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors\u2019 Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people.\r\n\r\nFor the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker\u2019s bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two\u2019s gruel. But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.\r\n\r\nThe room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes. Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more\u2014except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides.\r\n\r\nThe bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn\u2019t been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nThe evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his cook\u2019s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, sir, I want some more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said the master at length, in a faint voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cI want some more.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe master aimed a blow at Oliver\u2019s head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.\r\n\r\nThe board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for more!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor more!\u201d said Mr. Limbkins. \u201cCompose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe did, sir,\u201d replied Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat boy will be hung,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cI know that boy will be hung.\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody controverted the prophetic gentleman\u2019s opinion. An animated discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish. In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning: \u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nRELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE\r\n\r\nFor a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual\u2019s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver\u2019s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed by the enemies of \u201cthe system,\u201d that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one morning, while Oliver\u2019s affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing. Mr. Gamfield\u2019s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.\r\n\r\n\u201cWo\u2014o!\u201d said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.\r\n\r\nThe donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey\u2019s. Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \u2019prentis,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, my man,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile. \u201cWhat of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good \u2019spectable chimbley-sweepin\u2019 bisness,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, \u201cI wants a \u2019prentis, and I am ready to take him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWalk in,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty trade,\u201d said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his wish.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,\u201d said another gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make \u2019em come down again,\u201d said Gamfield; \u201cthat\u2019s all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain\u2019t o\u2019 no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that\u2019s wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen\u2019l\u2019men, and there\u2019s nothink like a good hot blaze to make \u2019em come down vith a run. It\u2019s humane too, gen\u2019l\u2019men, acause, even if they\u2019ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes \u2019em struggle to hextricate theirselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words \u201csaving of expenditure,\u201d \u201clooked well in the accounts,\u201d \u201chave a printed report published,\u201d were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.\r\n\r\nAt length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have considered your proposition, and we don\u2019t approve of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cDecidedly not,\u201d added the other members.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t let me have him, gen\u2019l\u2019men?\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr. Limbkins; \u201cat least, as it\u2019s a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield\u2019s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said,\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you give, gen\u2019l\u2019men? Come! Don\u2019t be too hard on a poor man. What\u2019ll you give?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say, three pound ten was plenty,\u201d said Mr. Limbkins.\r\n\r\n\u201cTen shillings too much,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d said Gamfield; \u201csay four pound, gen\u2019l\u2019men. Say four pound, and you\u2019ve got rid of him for good and all. There!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThree pound ten,\u201d repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome! I\u2019ll split the diff\u2019erence, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d urged Gamfield. \u201cThree pound fifteen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a farthing more,\u201d was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re desperate hard upon me, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d said Gamfield, wavering.\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh! pooh! nonsense!\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cHe\u2019d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly fellow! He\u2019s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and then: it\u2019ll do him good; and his board needn\u2019t come very expensive, for he hasn\u2019t been overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself. The bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that very afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. \u201cYou\u2019re a going to be made a \u2019prentice of, Oliver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA prentice, sir!\u201d said the child, trembling.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Oliver,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThe kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a going to \u201cprentice\u201d you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!\u2014three pound ten, Oliver!\u2014seventy shillins\u2014one hundred and forty sixpences!\u2014and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can\u2019t love.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child\u2019s face, and he sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced; \u201cCome, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don\u2019t cry into your gruel; that\u2019s a very foolish action, Oliver.\u201d It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.\r\n\r\nOn their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch him.\r\n\r\nThere the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.\u201d As Mr. Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, \u201cMind what I told you, you young rascal!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble\u2019s face at this somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great window. Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the boy, your worship,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, is this the boy?\u201d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is him, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cBow to the magistrate, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates\u2019 powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cI suppose he\u2019s fond of chimney-sweeping?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe doats on it, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he will be a sweep, will he?\u201d inquired the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he\u2019d run away simultaneous, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this man that\u2019s to be his master\u2014you, sir\u2014you\u2019ll treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?\u201d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I says I will, I means I will,\u201d replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted man,\u201d said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver\u2019s premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn\u2019t reasonably be expected to discern what other people did.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope I am, sir,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt you are, my friend,\u201d replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand.\r\n\r\nIt was the critical moment of Oliver\u2019s fate. If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off. But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy boy!\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cyou look pale and alarmed. What is the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStand a little away from him, Beadle,\u201d said the other magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest. \u201cNow, boy, tell us what\u2019s the matter: don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they would order him back to the dark room\u2014that they would starve him\u2014beat him\u2014kill him if they pleased\u2014rather than send him away with that dreadful man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity. \u201cWell! of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, Beadle,\u201d said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your worship\u2019s pardon,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having heard aright. \u201cDid your worship speak to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Hold your tongue.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold his tongue! A moral revolution!\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his companion, he nodded significantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe refuse to sanction these indentures,\u201d said the old gentleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d stammered Mr. Limbkins: \u201cI hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter,\u201d said the second old gentleman sharply. \u201cTake the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nOLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE\r\n\r\nIn great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea. The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class. The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity. His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d said the beadle, as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. \u201cI say you\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink so?\u201d said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event. \u201cThe prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr. Bumble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo are the coffins,\u201d replied the beadle: with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation. \u201cWell, well, Mr. Bumble,\u201d he said at length, \u201cthere\u2019s no denying that, since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble. Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cevery trade has its drawbacks. A fair profit is, of course, allowable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cand if I don\u2019t get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the long-run, you see\u2014he! he! he!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust so,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cThough I must say,\u201d continued the undertaker, resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted: \u201cthough I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four inches over one\u2019s calculation makes a great hole in one\u2019s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the bye,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cyou don\u2019t know anybody who wants a boy, do you? A porochial \u2019prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?\u201d As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words \u201cfive pounds\u201d: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.\r\n\r\n\u201cGadso!\u201d said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged lappel of his official coat; \u201cthat\u2019s just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about. You know\u2014dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think it rather pretty,\u201d said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. \u201cThe die is the same as the porochial seal\u2014the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear\u2019s morning, Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI recollect,\u201d said the undertaker. \u201cThe jury brought it in, \u2018Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,\u2019 didn\u2019t they?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they made it a special verdict, I think,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cby adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTush! Foolery!\u201d interposed the beadle. \u201cIf the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they\u2019d have enough to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery true,\u201d said the undertaker; \u201cthey would indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJuries,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when working into a passion: \u201cjuries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they are,\u201d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t no more philosophy nor political economy about \u2019em than that,\u201d said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more they have,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cI despise \u2019em,\u201d said the beadle, growing very red in the face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d rejoined the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I only wish we\u2019d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a week or two,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cthe rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet \u2019em alone for that,\u201d replied the undertaker. So saying, he smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.\r\n\r\nMr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell; what about the boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cwhy, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the poor\u2019s rates.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHem!\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied the undertaker, \u201cI was thinking that if I pay so much towards \u2019em, I\u2019ve a right to get as much out of \u2019em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so\u2014I think I\u2019ll take the boy myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the building. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening \u201cupon liking\u201d\u2014a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what he likes with.\r\n\r\nWhen little Oliver was taken before \u201cthe gentlemen\u201d that evening; and informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a coffin-maker\u2019s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.\r\n\r\nNow, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand\u2014which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep\u2014he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble\u2019s coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.\r\n\r\nFor some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble\u2019s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver!\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cPull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another. The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one. Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble\u2019s he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity. \u201cWell! Of all the ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, sir,\u201d sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the well-known cane; \u201cno, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so\u2014so\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo what?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo lonely, sir! So very lonely!\u201d cried the child. \u201cEverybody hates me. Oh! sir, don\u2019t, don\u2019t pray be cross to me!\u201d The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion\u2019s face, with tears of real agony.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble regarded Oliver\u2019s piteous and helpless look, with some astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner; and after muttering something about \u201cthat troublesome cough,\u201d bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; \u201cis that you, Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one else, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cHere! I\u2019ve brought the boy.\u201d Oliver made a bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! that\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said the undertaker: raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. \u201cMrs. Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, thin, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, \u201cthis is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.\u201d Oliver bowed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, \u201che\u2019s very small.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he is rather small,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger; \u201che is small. There\u2019s no denying it. But he\u2019ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry\u2014he\u2019ll grow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I dare say he will,\u201d replied the lady pettishly, \u201con our victuals and our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they\u2019re worth. However, men always think they know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o\u2019 bones.\u201d With this, the undertaker\u2019s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated \u201ckitchen\u201d; wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, Charlotte,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, \u201cgive this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He hasn\u2019t come home since the morning, so he may go without \u2019em. I dare say the boy isn\u2019t too dainty to eat \u2019em\u2014are you, boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.\r\n\r\nI wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected. I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, when Oliver had finished his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his future appetite: \u201chave you done?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen come with me,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; \u201cyour bed\u2019s under the counter. You don\u2019t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn\u2019t much matter whether you do or don\u2019t, for you can\u2019t sleep anywhere else. Come; don\u2019t keep me here all night!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER\u2019S BUSINESS\r\n\r\nOliver, being left to himself in the undertaker\u2019s shop, set the lamp down on a workman\u2019s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror. Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets. Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave.\r\n\r\nNor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.\r\n\r\nBut his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.\r\n\r\nOliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times. When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen the door, will yer?\u201d cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, directly, sir,\u201d replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose yer the new boy, ain\u2019t yer?\u201d said the voice through the key-hole.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow old are yer?\u201d inquired the voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cTen, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll whop yer when I get in,\u201d said the voice; \u201cyou just see if I don\u2019t, that\u2019s all, my work\u2019us brat!\u201d and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle.\r\n\r\nOliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; \u201cdid you knock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI kicked,\u201d replied the charity-boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you want a coffin, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver, innocently.\r\n\r\nAt this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer don\u2019t know who I am, I suppose, Work\u2019us?\u201d said the charity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Mister Noah Claypole,\u201d said the charity-boy, \u201cand you\u2019re under me. Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!\u201d With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.\r\n\r\nOliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that \u201che\u2019d catch it,\u201d condescended to help him. Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. Oliver having \u201ccaught it,\u201d in fulfilment of Noah\u2019s prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome near the fire, Noah,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cI saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master\u2019s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah\u2019s back, and take them bits that I\u2019ve put out on the cover of the bread-pan. There\u2019s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they\u2019ll want you to mind the shop. D\u2019ye hear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019ye hear, Work\u2019us?\u201d said Noah Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cLor, Noah!\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cwhat a rum creature you are! Why don\u2019t you let the boy alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet him alone!\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhy everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you queer soul!\u201d said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.\r\n\r\nNoah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of \u201cleathers,\u201d \u201ccharity,\u201d and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.\r\n\r\nOliver had been sojourning at the undertaker\u2019s some three weeks or a month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry\u2014the shop being shut up\u2014were taking their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear\u2014\u201d He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, my dear, nothing,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cUgh, you brute!\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me what you were going to say,\u201d interposed Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cI am nobody; don\u2019t consult me, pray. I don\u2019t want to intrude upon your secrets.\u201d As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear,\u201d said Sowerberry, \u201cI want to ask your advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t ask mine,\u201d replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting manner: \u201cask somebody else\u2019s.\u201d Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear. After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only about young Twist, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry. \u201cA very good-looking boy, that, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe need be, for he eats enough,\u201d observed the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,\u201d resumed Mr. Sowerberry, \u201cwhich is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the good lady\u2019s part, proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only for children\u2019s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb effect.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband\u2019s mind before? Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance; \u201can order for a coffin, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like himself, was very corpulent.\r\n\r\n\u201cBayton,\u201d said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble. \u201cI never heard the name before.\u201d\r\n\r\nBumble shook his head, as he replied, \u201cObstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry; very obstinate. Proud, too, I\u2019m afraid, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProud, eh?\u201d exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. \u201cCome, that\u2019s too much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s sickening,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cAntimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe only heard of the family the night before last,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cand we shouldn\u2019t have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad. He had gone out to dinner; but his \u2019prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent \u2019em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, there\u2019s promptness,\u201d said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cPromptness, indeed!\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cBut what\u2019s the consequence; what\u2019s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won\u2019t suit his wife\u2019s complaint, and so she shan\u2019t take it\u2014says she shan\u2019t take it, sir! Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before\u2014sent \u2019em for nothing, with a blackin\u2019-bottle in,\u2014and he sends back word that she shan\u2019t take it, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble\u2019s mind in full force, he struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with indignation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cI ne\u2014ver\u2014did\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever did, sir!\u201d ejaculated the beadle. \u201cNo, nor nobody never did; but now she\u2019s dead, we\u2019ve got to bury her; and that\u2019s the direction; and the sooner it\u2019s done, the better.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble\u2019s voice. He needn\u2019t have taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble\u2019s glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, \u201cthe sooner this job is done, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap, and come with me.\u201d Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional mission.\r\n\r\nThey walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their search. The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.\r\n\r\nThere was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.\r\n\r\nIt was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed him.\r\n\r\nThere was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket. Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe man\u2019s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot. The old woman\u2019s face was wrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody shall go near her,\u201d said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess. \u201cKeep back! Damn you, keep back, if you\u2019ve a life to lose!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense, my good man,\u201d said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes. \u201cNonsense!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you,\u201d said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously on the floor,\u2014\u201cI tell you I won\u2019t have her put into the ground. She couldn\u2019t rest there. The worms would worry her\u2014not eat her\u2014she is so worn away.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman; \u201ckneel down, kneel down\u2014kneel round her, every one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the dark\u2014in the dark! She couldn\u2019t even see her children\u2019s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it! They starved her!\u201d He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering his lips.\r\n\r\nThe terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the undertaker.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was my daughter,\u201d said the old woman, nodding her head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. \u201cLord, Lord! Well, it is strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff! Lord, Lord!\u2014to think of it; it\u2019s as good as a play\u2014as good as a play!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, stop!\u201d said the old woman in a loud whisper. \u201cWill she be buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night? I laid her out; and I must walk, you know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold. We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send some bread\u2014only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some bread, dear?\u201d she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker\u2019s coat, as he once more moved towards the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cof course. Anything you like!\u201d He disengaged himself from the old woman\u2019s grasp; and, drawing Oliver after him, hurried away.\r\n\r\nThe next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!\u201d whispered Sowerberry in the old woman\u2019s ear; \u201cwe are rather late; and it won\u2019t do, to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,\u2014as quick as you like!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his master\u2019s, ran by the side.\r\n\r\nThere was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave. Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Bill!\u201d said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. \u201cFill up!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, my good fellow!\u201d said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. \u201cThey want to shut up the yard.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon. The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their different ways.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry, as they walked home, \u201chow do you like it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well, thank you, sir\u201d replied Oliver, with considerable hesitation. \u201cNot very much, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you\u2019ll get used to it in time, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry. \u201cNothing when you are used to it, my boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nOLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM\r\n\r\nThe month\u2019s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry\u2019s ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses.\r\n\r\nFor instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be\u2014quite cheerful and contented\u2014conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them. Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.\r\n\r\nThat Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver\u2019s history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings.\r\n\r\nOne day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton\u2014a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck\u2014when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.\r\n\r\nIntent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth; and pulled Oliver\u2019s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a \u201csneak\u201d; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was. But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny. He got rather personal.\r\n\r\n\u201cWork\u2019us,\u201d said Noah, \u201chow\u2019s your mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d replied Oliver; \u201cdon\u2019t you say anything about her to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying. Under this impression he returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she die of, Work\u2019us?\u201d said Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,\u201d replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. \u201cI think I know what it must be to die of that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work\u2019us,\u201d said Noah, as a tear rolled down Oliver\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s set you a snivelling now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot you,\u201d replied Oliver, sharply. \u201cThere; that\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t say anything more to me about her; you\u2019d better not!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter not!\u201d exclaimed Noah. \u201cWell! Better not! Work\u2019us, don\u2019t be impudent. Your mother, too! She was a nice \u2019un she was. Oh, Lor!\u201d And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer know, Work\u2019us,\u201d continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver\u2019s silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying: \u201cYer know, Work\u2019us, it can\u2019t be helped now; and of course yer couldn\u2019t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I\u2019m sure we all are, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work\u2019us, yer mother was a regular right-down bad \u2019un.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA regular right-down bad \u2019un, Work\u2019us,\u201d replied Noah, coolly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a great deal better, Work\u2019us, that she died when she did, or else she\u2019d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung; which is more likely than either, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\nCrimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.\r\n\r\nA minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll murder me!\u201d blubbered Noah. \u201cCharlotte! missis! Here\u2019s the new boy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver\u2019s gone mad! Char\u2014lotte!\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah\u2019s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you little wretch!\u201d screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training. \u201cOh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!\u201d And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society.\r\n\r\nCharlotte\u2019s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be effectual in calming Oliver\u2019s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.\r\n\r\nThis was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless her, she\u2019s going off!\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cA glass of water, Noah, dear. Make haste!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! Charlotte,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could, through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. \u201cOh! Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! mercy indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI only hope this\u2019ll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was all but killed, ma\u2019am, when I come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the charity-boy.\r\n\r\nNoah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver\u2019s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed some affecting tears and sniffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to be done!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cYour master\u2019s not at home; there\u2019s not a man in the house, and he\u2019ll kick that door down in ten minutes.\u201d Oliver\u2019s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear! I don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cunless we send for the police-officers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr the millingtary,\u201d suggested Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver\u2019s old friend. \u201cRun to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It\u2019ll keep the swelling down.\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nOLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with the boy!\u201d said the old pauper.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,\u2014which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Bumble, sir!\u201d said Noah: \u201cOliver, sir,\u2014Oliver has\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? What?\u201d interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes. \u201cNot run away; he hasn\u2019t run away, has he, Noah?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he\u2019s turned wicious,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cHe tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony, please, sir!\u201d And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.\r\n\r\nWhen Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman\u2019s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, \u201cwho has been nearly murdered\u2014all but murdered, sir,\u2014by young Twist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short. \u201cI knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his missis,\u201d interposed Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his master, too, I think you said, Noah?\u201d added Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! he\u2019s out, or he would have murdered him,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cHe said he wanted to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cAnd please, sir, missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him\u2014\u2019cause master\u2019s out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my boy; certainly,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah\u2019s head, which was about three inches higher than his own. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy\u2014a very good boy. Here\u2019s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry\u2019s with your cane, and see what\u2019s best to be done. Don\u2019t spare him, Bumble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I will not, sir,\u201d replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner\u2019s satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nHere the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome; you let me out!\u201d replied Oliver, from the inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know this here voice, Oliver?\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cAin\u2019t you afraid of it, sir? Ain\u2019t you a-trembling while I speak, sir?\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d replied Oliver, boldly.\r\n\r\nAn answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Madness, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation. \u201cIt\u2019s Meat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cMeat, ma\u2019am, meat,\u201d replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. \u201cYou\u2019ve over-fed him, ma\u2019am. You\u2019ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma\u2019am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It\u2019s quite enough that we let \u2019em have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma\u2019am, this would never have happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear!\u201d ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling: \u201cthis comes of being liberal!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble\u2019s heavy accusation. Of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; \u201cthe only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he\u2019s a little starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this point of Mr. Bumble\u2019s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible. Sowerberry returned at this juncture. Oliver\u2019s offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead. The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, you are a nice young fellow, ain\u2019t you?\u201d said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe called my mother names,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cShe deserved what he said, and worse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe did,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nThis flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went\u2014it was not very extensive\u2014kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble\u2019s subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day\u2019s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy\u2019s eyes, farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the door. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.\r\n\r\nWith the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look around\u2014one moment\u2019s pause of hesitation\u2014he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street.\r\n\r\nHe looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.\r\n\r\nHe remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.\r\n\r\nAlong this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm. His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on.\r\n\r\nHe reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, Dick!\u201d said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him. \u201cIs any one up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody but me,\u201d replied the child.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou musn\u2019t say you saw me, Dick,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI am running away. They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off. I don\u2019t know where. How pale you are!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard the doctor tell them I was dying,\u201d replied the child with a faint smile. \u201cI am very glad to see you, dear; but don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, I will, to say good-b\u2019ye to you,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI shall see you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d replied the child. \u201cAfter I am dead, but not before. I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. Kiss me,\u201d said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver\u2019s neck. \u201cGood-b\u2019ye, dear! God bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe blessing was from a young child\u2019s lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nOLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN\r\n\r\nOliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained the high-road. It was eight o\u2019clock now. Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.\r\n\r\nThe stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy\u2019s mind.\r\n\r\nLondon!\u2014that great place!\u2014nobody\u2014not even Mr. Bumble\u2014could ever find him there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.\r\n\r\nHe had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too\u2014a gift of Sowerberry\u2019s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well\u2014in his pocket. \u201cA clean shirt,\u201d thought Oliver, \u201cis a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles\u2019 walk in winter time.\u201d But Oliver\u2019s thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.\r\n\r\nOliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.\r\n\r\nHe felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he passed. He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along.\r\n\r\nHe waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn\u2019t deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.\r\n\r\nIn some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail. This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady\u2019s ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he begged at a farmer\u2019s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle\u2014which brought Oliver\u2019s heart into his mouth,\u2014very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver\u2019s troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother\u2019s; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king\u2019s highway. But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford\u2014and more\u2014with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver\u2019s soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.\r\n\r\nEarly on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.\r\n\r\nHe had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen. He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man. He was short of his age: with rather bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment\u2014and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again. He wore a man\u2019s coat, which reached nearly to his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them. He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d said this strange young gentleman to Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very hungry and tired,\u201d replied Oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke. \u201cI have walked a long way. I have been walking these seven days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWalking for sivin days!\u201d said the young gentleman. \u201cOh, I see. Beak\u2019s order, eh? But,\u201d he added, noticing Oliver\u2019s look of surprise, \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird\u2019s mouth described by the term in question.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy eyes, how green!\u201d exclaimed the young gentleman. \u201cWhy, a beak\u2019s a madgst\u2019rate; and when you walk by a beak\u2019s order, it\u2019s not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you never on the mill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat mill?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat mill! Why, the mill\u2014the mill as takes up so little room that it\u2019ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind\u2019s low with people, than when it\u2019s high; acos then they can\u2019t get workmen. But come,\u201d said the young gentleman; \u201cyou want grub, and you shall have it. I\u2019m at low-water-mark myself\u2014only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I\u2019ll fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There! Now then! Morrice!\u201d\r\n\r\nAssisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler\u2019s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, \u201ca fourpenny bran!\u201d the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend\u2019s bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing to London?\u201d said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length concluded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGot any lodgings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the big coat-sleeves would let them go.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you live in London?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I do, when I\u2019m at home,\u201d replied the boy. \u201cI suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do, indeed,\u201d answered Oliver. \u201cI have not slept under a roof since I left the country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret your eyelids on that score,\u201d said the young gentleman. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a \u2019spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot\u2019ll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the change\u2014that is, if any genelman he knows interduces you. And don\u2019t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means. Certainly not!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his friend\u2019s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkin\u2019s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron\u2019s interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of \u201cThe Artful Dodger,\u201d Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him. Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAs John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o\u2019clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington. They crossed from the Angel into St. John\u2019s Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed or harmless errands.\r\n\r\nOliver was just considering whether he hadn\u2019t better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then!\u201d cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlummy and slam!\u201d was the reply.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man\u2019s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s two on you,\u201d said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and shielding his eyes with his hand. \u201cWho\u2019s the t\u2019other one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA new pal,\u201d replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGreenland. Is Fagin upstairs?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s a sortin\u2019 the wipes. Up with you!\u201d The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared.\r\n\r\nOliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them.\r\n\r\nHe threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.\r\n\r\nThe walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt. There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate. In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men. These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is him, Fagin,\u201d said Jack Dawkins; \u201cmy friend Oliver Twist.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance. Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very hard\u2014especially the one in which he held his little bundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed. These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew\u2019s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cDodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah, you\u2019re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a good many of \u2019em, ain\u2019t there? We\u2019ve just looked \u2019em out, ready for the wash; that\u2019s all, Oliver; that\u2019s all. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of which they went to supper.\r\n\r\nOliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired. Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nCONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS\r\n\r\nIt was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.\r\n\r\nOliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan\u2019s sides: and yet the self-same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known.\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in. Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin. \u201cClever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn\u2019t have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.\r\n\r\nHaving replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it\u2019s a fine thing for the trade! Five of \u2019em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white-livered!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver\u2019s face; the boy\u2019s eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant\u2014for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived\u2014it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.\r\n\r\nHe closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said the Jew. \u201cWhat do you watch me for? Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick\u2014quick! for your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to sleep any longer, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, meekly. \u201cI am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not awake an hour ago?\u201d said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! No, indeed!\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and a threatening attitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon my word I was not, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, earnestly. \u201cI was not, indeed, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTush, tush, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. \u201cOf course I know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You\u2019re a brave boy. Ha! ha! you\u2019re a brave boy, Oliver.\u201d The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you see any of these pretty things, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning rather pale. \u201cThey\u2014they\u2019re mine, Oliver; my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\u201d replied the old gentleman. \u201cStay. There\u2019s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and I\u2019ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew\u2019s directions, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to the Dodger, \u201cI hope you\u2019ve been at work this morning, my dears?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHard,\u201d replied the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs nails,\u201d added Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boys, good boys!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cWhat have you got, Dodger?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA couple of pocket-books,\u201d replied that young gentlman.\r\n\r\n\u201cLined?\u201d inquired the Jew, with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well,\u201d replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one green, and the other red.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so heavy as they might be,\u201d said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; \u201cbut very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman, ain\u2019t he, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery indeed, sir,\u201d said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what have you got, my dear?\u201d said Fagin to Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cWipes,\u201d replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, inspecting them closely; \u201cthey\u2019re very good ones, very. You haven\u2019t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we\u2019ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much, indeed, if you\u2019ll teach me, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is so jolly green!\u201d said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver\u2019s hair over his eyes, and said he\u2019d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver\u2019s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious.\r\n\r\nWhen the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn\u2019t lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the spectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again.\r\n\r\nWhen this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.\r\n\r\nThe visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof. This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cThat\u2019s a pleasant life, isn\u2019t it? They have gone out for the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave they done work, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthat is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won\u2019t neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it. Make \u2019em your models, my dear. Make \u2019em your models,\u201d tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; \u201cdo everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters\u2014especially the Dodger\u2019s, my dear. He\u2019ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.\u2014Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, stopping short.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at play this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it gone?\u201d cried the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere it is, sir,\u201d said Oliver, showing it in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a clever boy, my dear,\u201d said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly. \u201cI never saw a sharper lad. Here\u2019s a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you\u2019ll be the greatest man of the time. And now come here, and I\u2019ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver wondered what picking the old gentleman\u2019s pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nOLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\nFor many days, Oliver remained in the Jew\u2019s room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.\r\n\r\nOliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman\u2019s character. Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.\r\n\r\nAt length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman\u2019s giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.\r\n\r\nThe three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first.\r\n\r\nThe pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction. These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.\r\n\r\nThey were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, \u201cThe Green\u201d: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d demanded Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cDo you see that old cove at the book-stall?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old gentleman over the way?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cYes, I see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cA prime plant,\u201d observed Master Charley Bates.\r\n\r\nOliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.\r\n\r\nWhat was Oliver\u2019s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman\u2019s pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed!\r\n\r\nIn an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy\u2019s mind.\r\n\r\nHe stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.\r\n\r\nThis was all done in a minute\u2019s space. In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d with all his might, made off after him, book in hand.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens.\r\n\r\nAlthough Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a passion FOR hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy. \u201cStop thief!\u201d Ay, stop him for God\u2019s sake, were it only in mercy!\r\n\r\nStopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse. \u201cStand aside!\u201d \u201cGive him a little air!\u201d \u201cNonsense! he don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the gentleman?\u201d \u201cHere his is, coming down the street.\u201d \u201cMake room there for the gentleman!\u201d \u201cIs this the boy, sir!\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cI am afraid it is the boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid!\u201d murmured the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che has hurt himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did that, sir,\u201d said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward; \u201cand preciously I cut my knuckle agin\u2019 his mouth. I stopped him, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, get up,\u201d said the man, roughly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,\u201d said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. \u201cThey are here somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, they ain\u2019t,\u201d said the officer. He meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, get up!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d said the old gentleman, compassionately.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, I won\u2019t hurt him,\u201d replied the officer, tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof. \u201cCome, I know you; it won\u2019t do. Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer\u2019s side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE\r\n\r\nThe offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office. The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d said the man carelessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young fogle-hunter,\u201d replied the man who had Oliver in charge.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you the party that\u2019s been robbed, sir?\u201d inquired the man with the keys.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the old gentleman; \u201cbut I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief. I\u2014I would rather not press the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMust go before the magistrate now, sir,\u201d replied the man. \u201cHis worship will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young gallows!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.\r\n\r\nThis cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night. But this is little. In our station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges\u2014the word is worth noting\u2014in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who doubts this, compare the two.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something in that boy\u2019s face,\u201d said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; \u201csomething that touches and interests me. Can he be innocent? He looked like\u2014Bye the bye,\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, \u201cBless my soul!\u2014where have I seen something like that look before?\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his mind\u2019s eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years. \u201cNo,\u201d said the old gentleman, shaking his head; \u201cit must be imagination.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver\u2019s features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book.\r\n\r\nHe was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\nThe office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene.\r\n\r\nMr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate\u2019s desk, said, suiting the action to the word, \u201cThat is my name and address, sir.\u201d He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.\r\n\r\n\u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper. \u201cWho is this fellow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name, sir,\u201d said the old gentleman, speaking like a gentleman, \u201cmy name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench.\u201d Saying this, Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information.\r\n\r\n\u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, \u201cwhat\u2019s this fellow charged with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not charged at all, your worship,\u201d replied the officer. \u201cHe appears against this boy, your worship.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe one.\r\n\r\n\u201cAppears against the boy, does he?\u201d said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. \u201cSwear him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cand that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have believed\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, sir!\u201d said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not, sir!\u201d replied the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue this instant, or I\u2019ll have you turned out of the office!\u201d said Mr. Fang. \u201cYou\u2019re an insolent impertinent fellow. How dare you bully a magistrate!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.\r\n\r\n\u201cSwear this person!\u201d said Fang to the clerk. \u201cI\u2019ll not hear another word. Swear him.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow\u2019s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Fang, \u201cwhat\u2019s the charge against this boy? What have you got to say, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was standing at a bookstall\u2014\u201d Mr. Brownlow began.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, sir,\u201d said Mr. Fang. \u201cPoliceman! Where\u2019s the policeman? Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre there any witnesses?\u201d inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone, your worship,\u201d replied the policeman.\r\n\r\nMr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not? You have been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I\u2019ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBy what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard\u2014accidently, of course.\r\n\r\nWith many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has been hurt already,\u201d said the old gentleman in conclusion. \u201cAnd I fear,\u201d he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, \u201cI really fear that he is ill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! yes, I dare say!\u201d said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. \u201cCome, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won\u2019t do. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, you hardened scoundrel?\u201d demanded Mr. Fang. \u201cOfficer, what\u2019s his name?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says his name\u2019s Tom White, your worship,\u201d said the kind-hearted thief-taker.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he won\u2019t speak out, won\u2019t he?\u201d said Fang. \u201cVery well, very well. Where does he live?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere he can, your worship,\u201d replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver\u2019s answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he any parents?\u201d inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says they died in his infancy, your worship,\u201d replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water.\r\n\r\n\u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Mr. Fang: \u201cdon\u2019t try to make a fool of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think he really is ill, your worship,\u201d remonstrated the officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know better,\u201d said Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care of him, officer,\u201d said the old gentleman, raising his hands instinctively; \u201che\u2019ll fall down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStand away, officer,\u201d cried Fang; \u201clet him, if he likes.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew he was shamming,\u201d said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof of the fact. \u201cLet him lie there; he\u2019ll soon be tired of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you propose to deal with the case, sir?\u201d inquired the clerk in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cSummarily,\u201d replied Mr. Fang. \u201cHe stands committed for three months\u2014hard labour of course. Clear the office.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, stop! don\u2019t take him away! For Heaven\u2019s sake stop a moment!\u201d cried the new comer, breathless with haste.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects, especially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press.[Footnote: Or were virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!\u201d cried Mr. Fang.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will speak,\u201d cried the man; \u201cI will not be turned out. I saw it all. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be put down. Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not refuse, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man was right. His manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up.\r\n\r\n\u201cSwear the man,\u201d growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. \u201cNow, man, what have you got to say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the man: \u201cI saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.\u201d Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come here before?\u201d said Fang, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t a soul to mind the shop,\u201d replied the man. \u201cEverybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I\u2019ve run here all the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe prosecutor was reading, was he?\u201d inquired Fang, after another pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied the man. \u201cThe very book he has in his hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that book, eh?\u201d said Fang. \u201cIs it paid for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not,\u201d replied the man, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, I forgot all about it!\u201d exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently.\r\n\r\n\u201cA nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!\u201d said Fang, with a comical effort to look humane. \u201cI consider, sir, that you have obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet. The boy is discharged. Clear the office!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2014n me!\u201d cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long, \u201cd\u2014n me! I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClear the office!\u201d said the magistrate. \u201cOfficers, do you hear? Clear the office!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment. Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. \u201cCall a coach, somebody, pray. Directly!\u201d\r\n\r\nA coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I accompany you?\u201d said the book-stall keeper, looking in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless me, yes, my dear sir,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow quickly. \u201cI forgot you. Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow! There\u2019s no time to lose.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nIN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nThe coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville. Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nBut, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever. The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame.\r\n\r\nWeak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream. Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat room is this? Where have I been brought to?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThis is not the place I went to sleep in.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once. The curtain at the bed\u2019s head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which she had been sitting at needle-work.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, my dear,\u201d said the old lady softly. \u201cYou must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,\u2014as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh. Lie down again; there\u2019s a dear!\u201d With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver\u2019s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cSave us!\u201d said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. \u201cWhat a grateful little dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps she does see me,\u201d whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; \u201cperhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was the fever, my dear,\u201d said the old lady mildly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose it was,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cbecause heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy. But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died. She can\u2019t know anything about me though,\u201d added Oliver after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cIf she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again.\r\n\r\nSo, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a great deal better, are you not, my dear?\u201d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know you are,\u201d said the gentleman: \u201cYou\u2019re hungry too, an\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d answered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHem!\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cNo, I know you\u2019re not. He is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,\u201d said the gentleman: looking very wise.\r\n\r\nThe old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou feel sleepy, don\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, rather thirsty,\u201d answered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural that he should be thirsty. You may give him a little tea, ma\u2019am, and some dry toast without any butter. Don\u2019t keep him too warm, ma\u2019am; but be careful that you don\u2019t let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady dropped a curtsey. The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs.\r\n\r\nOliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o\u2019clock. The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy\u2019s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven.\r\n\r\nGradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from. Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past!\r\n\r\nIt had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt cheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past. He belonged to the world again.\r\n\r\nIn three days\u2019 time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper\u2019s room, which belonged to her. Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind me, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI\u2019m only having a regular good cry. There; it\u2019s all over now; and I\u2019m quite comfortable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very, very kind to me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, never you mind that, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cthat\u2019s got nothing to do with your broth; and it\u2019s full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he\u2019ll be pleased.\u201d And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you fond of pictures, dear?\u201d inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite know, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the canvas; \u201cI have seen so few that I hardly know. What a beautiful, mild face that lady\u2019s is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the old lady, \u201cpainters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn\u2019t get any custom, child. The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed; it\u2019s a deal too honest. A deal,\u201d said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own acuteness.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs\u2014is that a likeness, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; \u201cthat\u2019s a portrait.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, really, my dear, I don\u2019t know,\u201d answered the old lady in a good-humoured manner. \u201cIt\u2019s not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so pretty,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, sure you\u2019re not afraid of it?\u201d said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, no,\u201d returned Oliver quickly; \u201cbut the eyes look so sorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart beat,\u201d added Oliver in a low voice, \u201cas if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord save us!\u201d exclaimed the old lady, starting; \u201cdon\u2019t talk in that way, child. You\u2019re weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won\u2019t see it. There!\u201d said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; \u201cyou don\u2019t see it now, at all events.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver did see it in his mind\u2019s eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nNow, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions. Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow\u2019s heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. \u201cI\u2019m rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. I\u2019m afraid I have caught cold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Bedwin. \u201cEverything you have had, has been well aired, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Bedwin. I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cI rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind that. How do you feel, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery happy, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cAnd very grateful indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. \u201cHave you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Bedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word: to intimate that between slops, and broth well compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; \u201ca couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn\u2019t they, Tom White, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Oliver, sir,\u201d replied the little invalid: with a look of great astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cOliver what? Oliver White, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQueer name!\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cWhat made you tell the magistrate your name was White?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never told him so, sir,\u201d returned Oliver in amazement.\r\n\r\nThis sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver\u2019s face. It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome mistake,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you are not angry with me, sir?\u201d said Oliver, raising his eyes beseechingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the old gentleman. \u201cWhy! what\u2019s this? Bedwin, look there!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver\u2019s head, and then to the boy\u2019s face. There was its living copy. The eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy!\r\n\r\nOliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording\u2014\r\n\r\nThat when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver\u2019s heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow\u2019s personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature\u2019s deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady\u2019s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut. Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves. Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d inquired the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d roared Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your noise,\u201d remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. \u201cDo you want to be grabbed, stupid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Charley, \u201cI can\u2019t help it! To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again\u2019 the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him\u2014oh, my eye!\u201d The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours. As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll Fagin say?\u201d inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d repeated Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, what?\u201d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what should he say?\u201d inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly in his merriment; for the Dodger\u2019s manner was impressive. \u201cWhat should he say?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat, scratched his head, and nodded thrice.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Charley.\r\n\r\n\u201cToor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn\u2019t, and high cockolorum,\u201d said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance.\r\n\r\nThis was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so; and again said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court. Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.\r\n\r\nThe noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how\u2019s this?\u201d muttered the Jew: changing countenance; \u201conly two of \u2019em? Where\u2019s the third? They can\u2019t have got into trouble. Hark!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nSOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Oliver?\u201d said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. \u201cWhere\u2019s the boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence; and looked uneasily at each other. But they made no reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s become of the boy?\u201d said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. \u201cSpeak out, or I\u2019ll throttle you!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar\u2014something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you speak?\u201d thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the traps have got him, and that\u2019s all about it,\u201d said the Dodger, sullenly. \u201cCome, let go o\u2019 me, will you!\u201d And, swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the Jew\u2019s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old gentleman\u2019s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced.\r\n\r\nThe Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant\u2019s head. But Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what the blazes is in the wind now!\u201d growled a deep voice. \u201cWho pitched that \u2019ere at me? It\u2019s well it\u2019s the beer, and not the pot, as hit me, or I\u2019d have settled somebody. I might have know\u2019d, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water\u2014and not that, unless he done the River Company every quarter. Wot\u2019s it all about, Fagin? D\u2014me, if my neck-handkercher an\u2019t lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master! Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;\u2014the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them. He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke. He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days\u2019 growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d growled this engaging ruffian.\r\n\r\nA white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in afore?\u201d said the man. \u201cYou\u2019re getting too proud to own me afore company, are you? Lie down!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you up to? Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious, in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?\u201d said the man, seating himself deliberately. \u201cI wonder they don\u2019t murder you! I would if I was them. If I\u2019d been your \u2019prentice, I\u2019d have done it long ago, and\u2014no, I couldn\u2019t have sold you afterwards, for you\u2019re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don\u2019t blow glass bottles large enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! hush! Mr. Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, trembling; \u201cdon\u2019t speak so loud!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of your mistering,\u201d replied the ruffian; \u201cyou always mean mischief when you come that. You know my name: out with it! I shan\u2019t disgrace it when the time comes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, then\u2014Bill Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, with abject humility. \u201cYou seem out of humour, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I am,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI should think you was rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing towards the boys.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly. He then, in cant terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd mind you don\u2019t poison it,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the table.\r\n\r\nThis was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller\u2019s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman\u2019s merry heart.\r\n\r\nAfter swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver\u2019s capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cthat he may say something which will get us into trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very likely,\u201d returned Sikes with a malicious grin. \u201cYou\u2019re blowed upon, Fagin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid, you see,\u201d added the Jew, speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man started, and turned round upon the Jew. But the old gentleman\u2019s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomebody must find out wot\u2019s been done at the office,\u201d said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he hasn\u2019t peached, and is committed, there\u2019s no fear till he comes out again,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, \u201cand then he must be taken care on. You must get hold of him somehow.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain the Jew nodded.\r\n\r\nThe prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted. This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever.\r\n\r\nHow long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess. It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe very thing!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cBet will go; won\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWheres?\u201d inquired the young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly just up to the office, my dear,\u201d said the Jew coaxingly.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be \u201cblessed\u201d if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.\r\n\r\nThe Jew\u2019s countenance fell. He turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl-papers, to the other female.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy, my dear,\u201d said the Jew in a soothing manner, \u201cwhat do you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat it won\u2019t do; so it\u2019s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I say, Bill,\u201d replied the lady collectedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re just the very person for it,\u201d reasoned Mr. Sikes: \u201cnobody about here knows anything of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd as I don\u2019t want \u2019em to, neither,\u201d replied Nancy in the same composed manner, \u201cit\u2019s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll go, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she won\u2019t, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she will, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission. She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,\u2014both articles of dress being provided from the Jew\u2019s inexhaustible stock,\u2014Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop a minute, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, producing, a little covered basket. \u201cCarry that in one hand. It looks more respectable, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive her a door-key to carry in her t\u2019other one, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cit looks real and genivine like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, my dear, so it does,\u201d said the Jew, hanging a large street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady\u2019s right hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!\u201d exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress. \u201cWhat has become of him! Where have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what\u2019s been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, she\u2019s a clever girl, my dears,\u201d said the Jew, turning round to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a honour to her sex,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and smiting the table with his enormous fist. \u201cHere\u2019s her health, and wishing they was all like her!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nEntering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cNolly, dear?\u201d murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; \u201cNolly?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument. He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d cried a faint and feeble voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there a little boy here?\u201d inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the voice; \u201cGod forbid.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for not playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing nothing for his livelihood. In the next cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp-office.\r\n\r\nBut, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear brother.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got him, my dear,\u201d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the gentleman\u2019s got him,\u201d replied the officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?\u201d exclaimed Nancy.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own residence: of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman.\r\n\r\nIn a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of, to the domicile of the Jew.\r\n\r\nMr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good-morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,\u201d said the Jew greatly excited. \u201cCharley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. I trust to you, my dear,\u2014to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,\u201d added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; \u201cthere\u2019s money, my dears. I shall shut up this shop to-night. You\u2019ll know where to find me! Don\u2019t stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver. Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing.\r\n\r\nA rap at the door startled him in this occupation. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he cried in a shrill tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe!\u201d replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d cried the Jew impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?\u201d inquired the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied the Jew, \u201cwherever she lays hands on him. Find him, find him out, that\u2019s all. I shall know what to do next; never fear.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his companions.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has not peached so far,\u201d said the Jew as he pursued his occupation. \u201cIf he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nCOMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER\u2019S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW\u2019S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND\r\n\r\nOliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow\u2019s abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver\u2019s history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him. He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the housekeeper\u2019s room next day, his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady. His expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt is gone, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it is ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWhy have they taken it away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,\u201d rejoined the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, indeed. It didn\u2019t worry me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI liked to see it. I quite loved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old lady, good-humouredly; \u201cyou get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I promise you that! Now, let us talk about something else.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time. As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea. After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach: and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed.\r\n\r\nThey were happy days, those of Oliver\u2019s recovery. Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself. He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself. This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again. They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little while.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,\u201d said Mrs. Bedwin. \u201cDear heart alive! If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say: looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn\u2019t think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens. There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading. When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down. Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser. Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are a good many books, are there not, my boy?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cA great number, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI never saw so many.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall read them, if you behave well,\u201d said the old gentleman kindly; \u201cand you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,\u2014that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,\u201d said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot always those,\u201d said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; \u201cthere are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size. How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I would rather read them, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! wouldn\u2019t you like to be a book-writer?\u201d said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nOliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing. Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it was.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the old gentleman, composing his features. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! We won\u2019t make an author of you, while there\u2019s an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him assume yet, \u201cI want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say. I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman\u2019s commencement! \u201cDon\u2019t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again. Let me stay here, and be a servant. Don\u2019t send me back to the wretched place I came from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear child,\u201d said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver\u2019s sudden appeal; \u201cyou need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never, never will, sir,\u201d interposed Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d rejoined the old gentleman. \u201cI do not think you ever will. I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself. The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections. Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, \u201cI only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again. You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement. Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you. Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he coming up?\u201d inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied the servant. \u201cHe asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go downstairs, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cI would rather you remained here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green. A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it. The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description. He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot. In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm\u2019s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here! do you see this! Isn\u2019t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can\u2019t call at a man\u2019s house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon\u2019s friend on the staircase? I\u2019ve been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I\u2019ll be content to eat my own head, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig\u2019s head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting\u2014to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll eat my head, sir,\u201d repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground. \u201cHallo! what\u2019s that!\u201d looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nOliver bowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say that\u2019s the boy who had the fever, I hope?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. \u201cWait a minute! Don\u2019t speak! Stop\u2014\u201d continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; \u201cthat\u2019s the boy who had the orange! If that\u2019s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I\u2019ll eat my head, and his too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, he has not had one,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. \u201cCome! Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel strongly on this subject, sir,\u201d said the irritable old gentleman, drawing off his gloves. \u201cThere\u2019s always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I know it\u2019s put there by the surgeon\u2019s boy at the corner. A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light. \u2018Don\u2019t go to him,\u2019 I called out of the window, \u2018he\u2019s an assassin! A man-trap!\u2019 So he is. If he is not\u2014\u201d Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, at length.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the boy,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you, boy?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cA great deal better, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the visitor\u2019s manner, he was very happy to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a nice-looking boy, is he not?\u201d inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know. I never see any difference in boys. I only knew two sort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd which is Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMealy. I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf. I know him! The wretch!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cthese are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he needn\u2019t excite your wrath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are not,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig. \u201cHe may have worse.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe may have worse, I say,\u201d repeated Mr. Grimwig. \u201cWhere does he come from! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever. What of that? Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes; haven\u2019t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master. He had had a fever six times; he wasn\u2019t recommended to mercy on that account. Pooh! nonsense!\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver\u2019s appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver\u2019s previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn\u2019t find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content to\u2014and so forth.\r\n\r\nAll this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman: knowing his friend\u2019s peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman\u2019s presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?\u201d asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed his subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow morning,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI would rather he was alone with me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o\u2019clock, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation, because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig\u2019s looking so hard at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; \u201che won\u2019t come up to you to-morrow morning. I saw him hesitate. He is deceiving you, my good friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll swear he is not,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he is not,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d and down went the stick.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll answer for that boy\u2019s truth with my life!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, knocking the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I for his falsehood with my head!\u201d rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking the table also.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; \u201cwe will.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cthere is something to go back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has gone, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Bedwin.\r\n\r\n\u201cCall after him,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cit\u2019s particular. He is a poor man, and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken back, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe street-door was opened. Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight. Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, I am very sorry for that,\u201d exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; \u201cI particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSend Oliver with them,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; \u201che will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI\u2019ll run all the way, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall go, my dear,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThe books are on a chair by my table. Fetch them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to say,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; \u201cyou are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him. This is a five-pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be ten minutes, sir,\u201d said Oliver, eagerly. Having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which Oliver said he clearly understood. Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless his sweet face!\u201d said the old lady, looking after him. \u201cI can\u2019t bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see; he\u2019ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. \u201cIt will be dark by that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you really expect him to come back, do you?\u201d inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig\u2019s breast, at the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend\u2019s confident smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiting the table with his fist, \u201cI do not. The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket. He\u2019ll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.\r\n\r\nIt grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nSHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE\r\n\r\nIn the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!\u201d said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog\u2019s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.\r\n\r\nDogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes\u2019s dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots. Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would, would you?\u201d said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew from his pocket. \u201cCome here, you born devil! Come here! D\u2019ye hear?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast.\r\n\r\nThis resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.\r\n\r\nThere must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog\u2019s participation, at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?\u201d said Sikes, with a fierce gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know, my dear, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d replied Fagin, humbly; for the Jew was the new comer.\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know, you white-livered thief!\u201d growled Sikes. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you hear the noise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a sound of it, as I\u2019m a living man, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no! You hear nothing, you don\u2019t,\u201d retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer. \u201cSneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d inquired the Jew with a forced smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cCause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven\u2019t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,\u201d replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; \u201cthat\u2019s why.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at ease, however.\r\n\r\n\u201cGrin away,\u201d said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with savage contempt; \u201cgrin away. You\u2019ll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it\u2019s behind a nightcap. I\u2019ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d\u2014me, I\u2019ll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cI know all that; we\u2014we\u2014have a mutual interest, Bill,\u2014a mutual interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHumph,\u201d said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew\u2019s side than on his. \u201cWell, what have you got to say to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all passed safe through the melting-pot,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand this is your share. It\u2019s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you\u2019ll do me a good turn another time, and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStow that gammon,\u201d interposed the robber, impatiently. \u201cWhere is it? Hand over!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,\u201d replied the Jew, soothingly. \u201cHere it is! All safe!\u201d As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all, is it?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?\u201d inquired Sikes, suspiciously. \u201cDon\u2019t put on an injured look at the question; you\u2019ve done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.\r\n\r\nBill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs anybody here, Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin; speaking, now that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cDot a shoul,\u201d replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody?\u201d inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cDobody but Biss Dadsy,\u201d replied Barney.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy!\u201d exclaimed Sikes. \u201cWhere? Strike me blind, if I don\u2019t honour that \u2019ere girl, for her native talents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,\u201d replied Barney.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend her here,\u201d said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. \u201cSend her here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBarney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are on the scent, are you, Nancy?\u201d inquired Sikes, proffering the glass.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am, Bill,\u201d replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; \u201cand tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat\u2019s been ill and confined to the crib; and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Nancy, dear!\u201d said Fagin, looking up.\r\n\r\nNow, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew\u2019s red eye-brows, and a half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance. The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes\u2019 time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book-stall. When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.\r\n\r\nHe was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. \u201cOh, my dear brother!\u201d And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d cried Oliver, struggling. \u201cLet go of me. Who is it? What are you stopping me for?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street-door key in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh my gracious!\u201d said the young woman, \u201cI have found him! Oh! Oliver! Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I\u2019ve found him. Thank gracious goodness heavins, I\u2019ve found him!\u201d With these incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher\u2019s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he didn\u2019t think he had better run for the doctor. To which, the butcher\u2019s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, no, never mind,\u201d said the young woman, grasping Oliver\u2019s hand; \u201cI\u2019m better now. Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the young woman, \u201che ran away, near a month ago, from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his mother\u2019s heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung wretch!\u201d said one woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo home, do, you little brute,\u201d said the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not,\u201d replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I haven\u2019t any sister, or father and mother either. I\u2019m an orphan; I live at Pentonville.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly hear him, how he braves it out!\u201d cried the young woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s Nancy!\u201d exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see he knows me!\u201d cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. \u201cHe can\u2019t help himself. Make him come home, there\u2019s good people, or he\u2019ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a white dog at his heels; \u201cyoung Oliver! Come home to your poor mother, you young dog! Come home directly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t belong to them. I don\u2019t know them. Help! help!\u201d cried Oliver, struggling in the man\u2019s powerful grasp.\r\n\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d repeated the man. \u201cYes; I\u2019ll help you, you young rascal! What books are these? You\u2019ve been a stealing \u2019em, have you? Give \u2019em here.\u201d With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way of bringing him to his senses!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure!\u201d cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look at the garret-window.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll do him good!\u201d said the two women.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he shall have it, too!\u201d rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. \u201cCome on, you young villain! Here, Bull\u2019s-eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!\u201d\r\n\r\nWeak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor child do! Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain.\r\n\r\nThe gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nRELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY\r\n\r\nThe narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle-market. Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear?\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.\r\n\r\nThey were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.\r\n\r\nOliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me the other,\u201d said Sikes, seizing Oliver\u2019s unoccupied hand. \u201cHere, Bull\u2019s-Eye!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dog looked up, and growled.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, boy!\u201d said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver\u2019s throat; \u201cif he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D\u2019ye mind!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn\u2019t!\u201d said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. \u201cNow, you know what you\u2019ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game. Get on, young\u2019un!\u201d\r\n\r\nBull\u2019s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.\r\n\r\nIt was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night was dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver\u2019s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.\r\n\r\nThey had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the hour. With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cEight o\u2019clock, Bill,\u201d said Nancy, when the bell ceased.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can\u2019t I!\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder whether they can hear it,\u201d said Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course they can,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cIt was Bartlemy time when I was shopped; and there warn\u2019t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn\u2019t hear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. \u201cOh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; that\u2019s all you women think of,\u201d answered Sikes. \u201cFine young chaps! Well, they\u2019re as good as dead, so it don\u2019t much matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver\u2019s wrist more firmly, told him to step out again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute!\u201d said the girl: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurry by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o\u2019clock struck, Bill. I\u2019d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn\u2019t a shawl to cover me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what good would that do?\u201d inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes. \u201cUnless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me. Come on, and don\u2019t stand preaching there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.\r\n\r\nThey walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many years.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.\r\n\r\nNancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house.\r\n\r\nThe passage was perfectly dark. They waited, while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnybody here?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the old \u2019un here?\u201d asked the robber.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied the voice, \u201cand precious down in the mouth he has been. Won\u2019t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver\u2019s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a glim,\u201d said Sikes, \u201cor we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStand still a moment, and I\u2019ll get you one,\u201d replied the voice. The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my wig, my wig!\u201d cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded: \u201chere he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin, look at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can\u2019t bear it; it is such a jolly game, I can\u2019t bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy. The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver\u2019s pockets with steady assiduity.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at his togs, Fagin!\u201d said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. \u201cLook at his togs! Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDelighted to see you looking so well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, bowing with mock humility. \u201cThe Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn\u2019t you write, my dear, and say you were coming? We\u2019d have got something warm for supper.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment.\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo, what\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note. \u201cThat\u2019s mine, Fagin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cMine, Bill, mine. You shall have the books.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that ain\u2019t mine!\u201d said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air; \u201cmine and Nancy\u2019s that is; I\u2019ll take the boy back again.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome! Hand over, will you?\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?\u201d inquired the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cFair, or not fair,\u201d retorted Sikes, \u201chand over, I tell you! Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew\u2019s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for our share of the trouble,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cand not half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you\u2019re fond of reading. If you ain\u2019t, sell \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re very pretty,\u201d said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; \u201cbeautiful writing, isn\u2019t is, Oliver?\u201d At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey belong to the old gentleman,\u201d said Oliver, wringing his hands; \u201cto the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back. He\u2019ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew\u2019s feet; and beat his hands together, in perfect desperation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy\u2019s right,\u201d remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Oliver, you\u2019re right; they will think you have stolen \u2019em. Ha! ha!\u201d chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have happened better, if we had chosen our time!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it couldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI know\u2019d that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. It\u2019s all right enough. They\u2019re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn\u2019t have taken him in at all; and they\u2019ll ask no questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He\u2019s safe enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep back the dog, Bill!\u201d cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. \u201cKeep back the dog; he\u2019ll tear the boy to pieces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cServe him right!\u201d cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl\u2019s grasp. \u201cStand off from me, or I\u2019ll split your head against the wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for that, Bill, I don\u2019t care for that,\u201d screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, \u201cthe child shan\u2019t be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShan\u2019t he!\u201d said Sikes, setting his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll soon do that, if you don\u2019t keep off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here!\u201d said Fagin, looking round.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe girl\u2019s gone mad, I think,\u201d replied Sikes, savagely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; \u201cno, she hasn\u2019t, Fagin; don\u2019t think it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen keep quiet, will you?\u201d said the Jew, with a threatening look.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t do that, neither,\u201d replied Nancy, speaking very loud. \u201cCome! What do you think of that?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at present. With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?\u201d said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; \u201ceh?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew\u2019s motions, and breathed quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?\u201d sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll cure you of that, my young master.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver\u2019s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t stand by and see it done, Fagin,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the boy, and what more would you have?\u2014Let him be\u2014let him be\u2014or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Nancy!\u201d said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; \u201cyou,\u2014you\u2019re more clever than ever to-night. Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I!\u201d said the girl. \u201cTake care I don\u2019t overdo it. You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy\u2019s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: \u201cwhat do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know who you are, and what you are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I know all about it,\u201d replied the girl, laughing hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, keep quiet,\u201d rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, \u201cor I\u2019ll quiet you for a good long time to come.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood came.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nice one,\u201d added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, \u201cto take up the humane and gen\u2014teel side! A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod Almighty help me, I am!\u201d cried the girl passionately; \u201cand I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here. He\u2019s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that\u2019s bad, from this night forth. Isn\u2019t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, come, Sikes,\u201d said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; \u201cwe must have civil words; civil words, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCivil words!\u201d cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see. \u201cCivil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve \u2019em from me. I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!\u201d pointing to Oliver. \u201cI have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. Don\u2019t you know it? Speak out! Don\u2019t you know it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; \u201cand, if you have, it\u2019s your living!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye, it is!\u201d returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream. \u201cIt is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you\u2019re the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that\u2019ll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall do you a mischief!\u201d interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; \u201ca mischief worse than that, if you say much more!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s all right now,\u201d said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. \u201cShe\u2019s uncommon strong in the arms, when she\u2019s up in this way.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst of having to do with women,\u201d said the Jew, replacing his club; \u201cbut they\u2019re clever, and we can\u2019t get on, in our line, without \u2019em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he\u2019d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?\u201d inquired Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow\u2019s; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his whereabout.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut off the smart ones,\u201d said Charley, \u201cand I\u2019ll give \u2019em to Fagin to take care of. What fun it is!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThe noise of Charley\u2019s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed. But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nOLIVER\u2019S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION\r\n\r\nIt is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.\r\n\r\nSuch changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight. The transitions in real life from well-spread boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference. The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.\r\n\r\nAs sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author\u2019s skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle\u2019s mind, too great for utterance.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrat that beadle!\u201d said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at the garden-gate. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t him at this time in the morning! Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it is a pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Mann,\u201d said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; \u201cMrs. Mann, ma\u2019am, good morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and good morning to you, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann, with many smiles; \u201cand hoping you find yourself well, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo-so, Mrs. Mann,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cA porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs. Mann.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that it isn\u2019t indeed, Mr. Bumble,\u201d rejoined the lady. And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety, if they had heard it.\r\n\r\n\u201cA porochial life, ma\u2019am,\u201d continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table with his cane, \u201cis a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!\u201d said the beadle.\r\n\r\nFinding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Mann, I am going to London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLauk, Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo London, ma\u2019am,\u201d resumed the inflexible beadle, \u201cby coach. I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann! A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement; and the board has appointed me\u2014me, Mrs. Mann\u2014to dispose to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.\r\n\r\nAnd I very much question,\u201d added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, \u201cwhether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you mustn\u2019t be too hard upon them, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble; \u201cand if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said,\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019re ill, Mrs. Mann,\u201d said the beadle. \u201cWe put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThey are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move \u2019em than to bury \u2019em\u2014that is, if we can throw \u2019em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don\u2019t die upon the road to spite us. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he became grave.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are forgetting business, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle; \u201chere is your porochial stipend for the month.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his pocket-book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much blotted, sir,\u201d said the farmer of infants; \u201cbut it\u2019s formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much obliged to you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann\u2019s curtsey; and inquired how the children were.\r\n\r\n\u201cBless their dear little hearts!\u201d said Mrs. Mann with emotion, \u201cthey\u2019re as well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two that died last week. And little Dick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that boy no better?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mann shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble angrily. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann. \u201cHere, you Dick!\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter some calling, Dick was discovered. Having had his face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann\u2019s gown, he was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.\r\n\r\nThe child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man.\r\n\r\nSuch was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble\u2019s glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the beadle\u2019s voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?\u201d said Mrs. Mann.\r\n\r\nThe child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, porochial Dick?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble, with well-timed jocularity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, sir,\u201d replied the child faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think not,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble\u2019s humour.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want for nothing, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like\u2014\u201d faltered the child.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey-day!\u201d interposed Mrs. Mann, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to say that you do want for something, now? Why, you little wretch\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, Mrs. Mann, stop!\u201d said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of authority. \u201cLike what, sir, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like,\u201d faltered the child, \u201cif somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what does the boy mean?\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed as he was to such things. \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like,\u201d said the child, \u201cto leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him. And I should like to tell him,\u201d said the child pressing his small hands together, and speaking with great fervour, \u201cthat I was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, \u201cThey\u2019re all in one story, Mrs. Mann. That out-dacious Oliver had demogalized them all!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have believed it, sir\u201d said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. \u201cI never see such a hardened little wretch!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him away, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Mr. Bumble imperiously. \u201cThis must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope the gentleman will understand that it isn\u2019t my fault, sir?\u201d said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey shall understand that, ma\u2019am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThere; take him away, I can\u2019t bear the sight on him.\u201d\r\n\r\nDick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar. Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.\r\n\r\nAt six o\u2019clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London.\r\n\r\nHe experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.\r\n\r\nThe very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble\u2019s eye rested, was the following advertisement.\r\n\r\n\u201cFIVE GUINEAS REWARD\r\n\r\n\u201cWhereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since been heard of. The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then followed a full description of Oliver\u2019s dress, person, appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Mr. Brownlow at home?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door.\r\n\r\nTo this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of \u201cI don\u2019t know; where do you come from?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver\u2019s name, in explanation of his errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d said the old lady: \u201cI knew we should hear of him. Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I said so all along.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did.\r\n\r\nHe was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:\r\n\r\n\u201cA beadle. A parish beadle, or I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray don\u2019t interrupt just now,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cTake a seat, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig\u2019s manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle\u2019s countenance; and said, with a little impatience,\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you ARE a beadle, are you not?\u201d inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, \u201cI knew he was. A beadle all over!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know where this poor boy is now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more than nobody,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what do you know of him?\u201d inquired the old gentleman. \u201cSpeak out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What do you know of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know any good of him, do you?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble\u2019s features.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with portentous solemnity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble\u2019s pursed-up countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments\u2019 reflection, commenced his story.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious if given in the beadle\u2019s words: occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents. That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice. That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from his master\u2019s house. In proof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow\u2019s observations.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear it is all too true,\u201d said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after looking over the papers. \u201cThis is not much for your intelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to the boy.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle\u2019s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him further.\r\n\r\nAt length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bedwin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; \u201cthat boy, Oliver, is an imposter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be, sir. It cannot be,\u201d said the old lady energetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you he is,\u201d retorted the old gentleman. \u201cWhat do you mean by can\u2019t be? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never will believe it, sir,\u201d replied the old lady, firmly. \u201cNever!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying story-books,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig. \u201cI knew it all along. Why didn\u2019t you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn\u2019t had a fever, I suppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn\u2019t he? Interesting! Bah!\u201d And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,\u201d retorted Mrs. Bedwin, indignantly. \u201cI know what children are, sir; and have done these forty years; and people who can\u2019t say the same, shouldn\u2019t say anything about them. That\u2019s my opinion!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from feeling. \u201cNever let me hear the boy\u2019s name again. I rang to tell you that. Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin. Remember! I am in earnest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow\u2019s that night.\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nHOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS\r\n\r\nAbout noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning. Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few select friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.\r\n\r\nLittle Oliver\u2019s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew\u2019s words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind. As he glanced timidly up, and met the Jew\u2019s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would be very good friends yet. Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the room-door behind him.\r\n\r\nAnd so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dirty place. The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways. From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now.\r\n\r\nSpiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. With these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned.\r\n\r\nIn all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends. Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver\u2019s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,\u2014which he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway.\r\n\r\nOliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal. So he at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as \u201cjapanning his trotter-cases.\u201d The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature. He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a pity it is he isn\u2019t a prig!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Master Charles Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates. They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t even know what a prig is?\u201d said the Dodger mournfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I know that,\u201d replied Oliver, looking up. \u201cIt\u2019s a the\u2014; you\u2019re one, are you not?\u201d inquired Oliver, checking himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cI\u2019d scorn to be anything else.\u201d Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d repeated the Dodger. \u201cSo\u2019s Charley. So\u2019s Fagin. So\u2019s Sikes. So\u2019s Nancy. So\u2019s Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he\u2019s the downiest one of the lot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the least given to peaching,\u201d added Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without wittles for a fortnight,\u201d said the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d observed Charley.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a rum dog. Don\u2019t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he\u2019s in company!\u201d pursued the Dodger. \u201cWon\u2019t he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing! And don\u2019t he hate other dogs as ain\u2019t of his breed! Oh, no!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s an out-and-out Christian,\u201d said Charley.\r\n\r\nThis was merely intended as a tribute to the animal\u2019s abilities, but it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes\u2019 dog, there exist strong and singular points of resemblance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t got anything to do with young Green here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more it has,\u201d said Charley. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd make your fortun\u2019 out of hand?\u201d added the Dodger, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,\u201d said Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d rejoined Oliver, timidly; \u201cI wish they would let me go. I\u2014I\u2014would rather go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Fagin would rather not!\u201d rejoined Charley.\r\n\r\nOliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d exclaimed the Dodger. \u201cWhy, where\u2019s your spirit? Don\u2019t you take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, blow that!\u201d said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, \u201cthat\u2019s too mean; that is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can leave your friends, though,\u201d said Oliver with a half smile; \u201cand let them be punished for what you did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, \u201cThat was all out of consideration for Fagin, \u2019cause the traps know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn\u2019t made our lucky; that was the move, wasn\u2019t it, Charley?\u201d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of Oliver\u2019s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here!\u201d said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence. \u201cHere\u2019s a jolly life! What\u2019s the odds where it comes from? Here, catch hold; there\u2019s plenty more where they were took from. You won\u2019t, won\u2019t you? Oh, you precious flat!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s naughty, ain\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d inquired Charley Bates. \u201cHe\u2019ll come to be scragged, won\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething in this way, old feller,\u201d said Charly. As he said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it means,\u201d said Charley. \u201cLook how he stares, Jack! I never did see such prime company as that \u2019ere boy; he\u2019ll be the death of me, I know he will.\u201d Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been brought up bad,\u201d said the Dodger, surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. \u201cFagin will make something of you, though, or you\u2019ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable. You\u2019d better begin at once; for you\u2019ll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you\u2019re only losing time, Oliver.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own: which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin\u2019s favour without more delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd always put this in your pipe, Nolly,\u201d said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, \u201cif you don\u2019t take fogels and tickers\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of talking in that way?\u201d interposed Master Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t take pocket-handkechers and watches,\u201d said the Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver\u2019s capacity, \u201csome other cove will; so that the coves that lose \u2019em will be all the worse, and you\u2019ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha\u2019p\u2019orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them\u2014and you\u2019ve just as good a right to them as they have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure, to be sure!\u201d said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver. \u201cIt all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger\u2019s word for it. Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his trade.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the Dodger\u2019s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his pupil\u2019s proficiency.\r\n\r\nThe conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.\r\n\r\nMr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements. He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his \u201ctime\u201d was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the County. The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working days; and that he \u201cwished he might be busted if he warn\u2019t as dry as a lime-basket.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young friend of mine, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s in luck, then,\u201d said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin. \u201cNever mind where I came from, young \u2019un; you\u2019ll find your way there, soon enough, I\u2019ll bet a crown!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.\r\n\r\nAfter some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers. These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself. At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two. Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.\r\n\r\nFrom this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver\u2019s, Mr. Fagin best knew. At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings.\r\n\r\nIn short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. Having prepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nIN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON\r\n\r\nIt was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den. He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could.\r\n\r\nThe house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields.\r\n\r\nThe mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.\r\n\r\nHe kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs.\r\n\r\nA dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man\u2019s voice demanded who was there.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly me, Bill; only me, my dear,\u201d said the Jew looking in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBring in your body then,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cLie down, you stupid brute! Don\u2019t you know the devil when he\u2019s got a great-coat on?\u201d\r\n\r\nApparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin\u2019s outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\u2014\u201cAh! Nancy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady\u2019s behaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is cold, Nancy dear,\u201d said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire. \u201cIt seems to go right through one,\u201d added the old man, touching his side.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,\u201d said Mr. Sikes. \u201cGive him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make haste! It\u2019s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.\u201d\r\n\r\nNancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! You\u2019re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. \u201cUgh!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once.\r\n\r\nThe Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a \u201clife-preserver\u201d that hung over the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Sikes, smacking his lips. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor business?\u201d inquired the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor business,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cso say what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout the crib at Chertsey, Bill?\u201d said the Jew, drawing his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Wot about it?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! you know what I mean, my dear,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cHe knows what I mean, Nancy; don\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he don\u2019t,\u201d sneered Mr. Sikes. \u201cOr he won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the same thing. Speak out, and call things by their right names; don\u2019t sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn\u2019t the very first that thought about the robbery. Wot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, Bill, hush!\u201d said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; \u201csomebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody will hear us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet \u2019em hear!\u201d said Sikes; \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d But as Mr. Sikes did care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew calmer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d said the Jew, coaxingly. \u201cIt was only my caution, nothing more. Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such plate!\u201d said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Sikes coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to be done at all!\u201d echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d rejoined Sikes. \u201cAt least it can\u2019t be a put-up job, as we expected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it hasn\u2019t been properly gone about,\u201d said the Jew, turning pale with anger. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I will tell you,\u201d retorted Sikes. \u201cWho are you that\u2019s not to be told? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he can\u2019t get one of the servants in line.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me, Bill,\u201d said the Jew: softening as the other grew heated: \u201cthat neither of the two men in the house can be got over?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do mean to tell you so,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cThe old lady has had \u2019em these twenty years; and if you were to give \u2019em five hundred pound, they wouldn\u2019t be in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you mean to say, my dear,\u201d remonstrated the Jew, \u201cthat the women can\u2019t be got over?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot by flash Toby Crackit?\u201d said the Jew incredulously. \u201cThink what women are, Bill,\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; not even by flash Toby Crackit,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cHe says he\u2019s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he\u2019s been loitering down there, and it\u2019s all of no use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear,\u201d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo he did,\u201d rejoined Sikes, \u201cand they warn\u2019t of no more use than the other plant.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, \u201cit\u2019s a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d said Mr. Sikes. \u201cWorse luck!\u201d\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time. Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; \u201cis it worth fifty shiners extra, if it\u2019s safely done from the outside?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it a bargain?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my dear, yes,\u201d rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew\u2019s hand, with some disdain, \u201clet it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters. The crib\u2019s barred up at night like a jail; but there\u2019s one part we can crack, safe and softly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich is that, Bill?\u201d asked the Jew eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d whispered Sikes, \u201cas you cross the lawn\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cUmph!\u201d cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew\u2019s face. \u201cNever mind which part it is. You can\u2019t do it without me, I know; but it\u2019s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you like, my dear, as you like\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cIs there no help wanted, but yours and Toby\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cCept a centre-bit and a boy. The first we\u2019ve both got; the second you must find us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed the Jew. \u201cOh! then it\u2019s a panel, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind wot it is!\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cI want a boy, and he musn\u2019t be a big \u2019un. Lord!\u201d said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, \u201cif I\u2019d only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper\u2019s! He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a \u2019prentice of him. And so they go on,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, \u201cso they go on; and, if they\u2019d got money enough (which it\u2019s a Providence they haven\u2019t,) we shouldn\u2019t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more we should,\u201d acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. \u201cBill!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room. Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want any beer,\u201d said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining her seat very composedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you I do!\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d rejoined the girl coolly, \u201cGo on, Fagin. I know what he\u2019s going to say, Bill; he needn\u2019t mind me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?\u201d he asked at length. \u201cYou\u2019ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil\u2019s in it. She ain\u2019t one to blab. Are you Nancy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think not!\u201d replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear, I know you\u2019re not,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cbut\u2014\u201d and again the old man paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut wot?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether she mightn\u2019t p\u2019r\u2019aps be out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\nAt this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of \u201cKeep the game a-going!\u201d \u201cNever say die!\u201d and the like. These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy with a laugh. \u201cTell Bill at once, about Oliver!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! you\u2019re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!\u201d said the Jew, patting her on the neck. \u201cIt was about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d demanded Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the boy for you, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe!\u201d exclaimed Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave him, Bill!\u201d said Nancy. \u201cI would, if I was in your place. He mayn\u2019t be so much up, as any of the others; but that\u2019s not what you want, if he\u2019s only to open a door for you. Depend upon it he\u2019s a safe one, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know he is,\u201d rejoined Fagin. \u201cHe\u2019s been in good training these last few weeks, and it\u2019s time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the others are all too big.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he is just the size I want,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,\u201d interposed the Jew; \u201che can\u2019t help himself. That is, if you frighten him enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrighten him!\u201d echoed Sikes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be no sham frightening, mind you. If there\u2019s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound. You won\u2019t see him alive again, Fagin. Think of that, before you send him. Mark my words!\u201d said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it all,\u201d said the Jew with energy. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve had my eye upon him, my dears, close\u2014close. Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and he\u2019s ours! Ours for his life. Oho! It couldn\u2019t have come about better!\u201d The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOurs!\u201d said Sikes. \u201cYours, you mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I do, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. \u201cMine, if you like, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd wot,\u201d said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, \u201cwot makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you might pick and choose from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re of no use to me, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, with some confusion, \u201cnot worth the taking. Their looks convict \u2019em when they get into trouble, and I lose \u2019em all. With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn\u2019t with twenty of them. Besides,\u201d said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, \u201che has us now if he could only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us. Never mind how he came there; it\u2019s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that\u2019s all I want. Now, how much better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way\u2014which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen is it to be done?\u201d asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin\u2019s affectation of humanity.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, to be sure,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cwhen is it to be done, Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,\u201d rejoined Sikes in a surly voice, \u201cif he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthere\u2019s no moon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d rejoined Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?\u201d asked the Jew.\r\n\r\nSikes nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd about\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ah, it\u2019s all planned,\u201d rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. \u201cNever mind particulars. You\u2019d better bring the boy here to-morrow night. I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew\u2019s next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else. It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations. At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Nancy,\u201d said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no flinching about the girl. She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be.\r\n\r\nThe Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways the way!\u201d muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward. \u201cThe worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts. Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!\u201d\r\n\r\nBeguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him,\u201d was his first remark as they descended the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cHours ago,\u201d replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. \u201cHere he is!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now,\u201d said the Jew, turning softly away. \u201cTo-morrow. To-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nWHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES\r\n\r\nWhen Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo\u2014to\u2014stop there, sir?\u201d asked Oliver, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear. Not to stop there,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t like to lose you. Don\u2019t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again. Ha! ha! ha! We won\u2019t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear. Oh no, no!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, \u201cyou want to know what you\u2019re going to Bill\u2019s for\u2014-eh, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, do you think?\u201d inquired Fagin, parrying the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy\u2019s face. \u201cWait till Bill tells you, then.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver\u2019s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin\u2019s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then. He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may burn a candle,\u201d said the Jew, putting one upon the table. \u201cAnd here\u2019s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you. Good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night!\u201d replied Oliver, softly.\r\n\r\nThe Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.\r\n\r\nOliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it. He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake heed, Oliver! take heed!\u201d said the old man, shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner. \u201cHe\u2019s a rough man, and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he bids you. Mind!\u201d Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room.\r\n\r\nOliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The more he thought of the Jew\u2019s admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning.\r\n\r\nHe could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged. He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely. He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read.\r\n\r\nHe turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume. It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony. Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of. The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\nIn a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him. Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.\r\n\r\nHe had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that!\u201d he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe. Only me,\u201d replied a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\nOliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. It was Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut down the light,\u201d said the girl, turning away her head. \u201cIt hurts my eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod forgive me!\u201d she cried after a while, \u201cI never thought of this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas anything happened?\u201d asked Oliver. \u201cCan I help you? I will if I can. I will, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy!\u201d cried Oliver, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold.\r\n\r\nOliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes over me sometimes,\u201d said she, affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; \u201cit\u2019s this damp dirty room, I think. Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I to go with you?\u201d asked Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I have come from Bill,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cYou are to go with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Oliver, recoiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy\u2019s face. \u201cOh! For no harm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Oliver: who had watched her closely.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave it your own way,\u201d rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. \u201cFor no good, then.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver could see that he had some power over the girl\u2019s better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state. But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o\u2019clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale. As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready.\r\n\r\nNeither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his companion. She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round. \u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself. I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nStruck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise. She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do now,\u201d continued the girl aloud; \u201cfor those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me. I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death. See here! I have borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and continued, with great rapidity:\r\n\r\n\u201cRemember this! And don\u2019t let me suffer more for you, just now. If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power. They don\u2019t mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every word from you is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your hand!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out. A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close. The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant.\r\n\r\nThe girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew\u2019s steps had been directed on the previous evening.\r\n\r\nFor one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl\u2019s voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time. \u201cBill!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo!\u201d replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle. \u201cOh! That\u2019s the time of day. Come on!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes\u2019 temperament. Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.\r\n\r\n\u201cBull\u2019s-eye\u2019s gone home with Tom,\u201d observed Sikes, as he lighted them up. \u201cHe\u2019d have been in the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d rejoined Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve got the kid,\u201d said Sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, here he is,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he come quiet?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike a lamb,\u201d rejoined Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; \u201cfor the sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it. Come here, young \u2019un; and let me read you a lectur\u2019, which is as well got over at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver\u2019s cap and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, first: do you know wot this is?\u201d inquired Sikes, taking up a pocket-pistol which lay on the table.\r\n\r\nOliver replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, look here,\u201d continued Sikes. \u201cThis is powder; that \u2019ere\u2019s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow it\u2019s loaded,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I see it is, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the robber, grasping Oliver\u2019s wrist, and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; \u201cif you speak a word when you\u2019re out o\u2019doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice. So, if you do make up your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs near as I know, there isn\u2019t anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you, if you was disposed of; so I needn\u2019t take this devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn\u2019t for your own good. D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe short and the long of what you mean,\u201d said Nancy: speaking very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words: \u201cis, that if you\u2019re crossed by him in this job you have on hand, you\u2019ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; \u201cwomen can always put things in fewest words.\u2014Except when it\u2019s blowing up; and then they lengthens it out. And now that he\u2019s thoroughly up to it, let\u2019s have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep\u2019s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of \u201cjemmies\u201d being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.\r\n\r\nSupper being ended\u2014it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it\u2014Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely. Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light. Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which hung over the back of a chair. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then!\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; \u201chalf-past five! Look sharp, or you\u2019ll get no breakfast; for it\u2019s late as it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready.\r\n\r\nNancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders. Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.\r\n\r\nOliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nIt was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops, and dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless and empty.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly begun to break. Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time. The public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open. By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with. Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town. As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle. It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.\r\n\r\nTurning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.\r\n\r\nIt was market-morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep. Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the senses.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, young \u2019un!\u201d said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew\u2019s Church, \u201chard upon seven! you must step out. Come, don\u2019t lag behind already, Lazy-legs!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion\u2019s wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as he could.\r\n\r\nThey held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up. Seeing \u201cHounslow\u201d written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth.\r\n\r\n\u201cJump up,\u201d said the man. \u201cIs that your boy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; he\u2019s my boy,\u201d replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father walks rather too quick for you, don\u2019t he, my man?\u201d inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes, interposing. \u201cHe\u2019s used to it. Here, take hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey. At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off. And here, the cart stopped.\r\n\r\nSikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, boy,\u201d said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s sulky,\u201d replied Sikes, giving him a shake; \u201che\u2019s sulky. A young dog! Don\u2019t mind him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I!\u201d rejoined the other, getting into his cart. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine day, after all.\u201d And he drove away.\r\n\r\nSikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey.\r\n\r\nThey turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen\u2019s houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, \u201cHampton.\u201d They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours. At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking and smoking. They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company.\r\n\r\nThey had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further. Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the man, who seemed a little the worse\u2014or better, as the case might be\u2014for drinking; \u201cand not slow about it neither. My horse hasn\u2019t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in the mornin\u2019; and he won\u2019t be long a-doing of it. Here\u2019s luck to him. Ecod! he\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?\u201d demanded Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going directly, I can,\u201d replied the man, looking out of the pot. \u201cAre you going to Halliford?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing on to Shepperton,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m your man, as far as I go,\u201d replied the other. \u201cIs all paid, Becky?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the other gentleman\u2019s paid,\u201d replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say!\u201d said the man, with tipsy gravity; \u201cthat won\u2019t do, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d rejoined Sikes. \u201cYou\u2019re a-going to accommodate us, and wot\u2019s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real good fellow. To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.\r\n\r\nAfter the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party start.\r\n\r\nThe horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing outside: ready harnessed to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two \u201cto bear him up,\u201d and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal, mounted also. Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.\r\n\r\nAs they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it. There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind. It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead.\r\n\r\nSunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road. Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.\r\n\r\nThey turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge.\r\n\r\nSikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe water!\u201d thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. \u201cHe has brought me to this lonely place to murder me!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous and decayed. There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible. The house was dark, dismantled: and, to all appearance, uninhabited.\r\n\r\nSikes, with Oliver\u2019s hand still in his, softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE BURGLARY\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo!\u201d cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make such a row,\u201d said Sikes, bolting the door. \u201cShow a glim, Toby.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha! my pal!\u201d cried the same voice. \u201cA glim, Barney, a glim! Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear?\u201d cried the same voice. \u201cThere\u2019s Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?\u201d\r\n\r\nA pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the public-house on Saffron Hill.\r\n\r\n\u201cBister Sikes!\u201d exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; \u201ccub id, sir; cub id.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere! you get on first,\u201d said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him. \u201cQuicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.\u201d\r\n\r\nMuttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe. He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings. He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill, my boy!\u201d said this figure, turning his head towards the door, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you\u2019d given it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!\u201d\r\n\r\nUttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy. Only the boy!\u201d replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cWud of Bister Fagid\u2019s lads,\u201d exclaimed Barney, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin\u2019s, eh!\u201d exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. \u201cWot an inwalable boy that\u2019ll make, for the old ladies\u2019 pockets in chapels! His mug is a fortin\u2019 to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2014there\u2019s enough of that,\u201d interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, \u201cif you\u2019ll give us something to eat and drink while we\u2019re waiting, you\u2019ll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you\u2019ll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far off.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table, \u201cSuccess to the crack!\u201d He rose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents. Mr. Sikes did the same.\r\n\r\n\u201cA drain for the boy,\u201d said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. \u201cDown with it, innocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man\u2019s face; \u201cindeed, I\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDown with it!\u201d echoed Toby. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had better!\u201d said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. \u201cBurn my body, if he isn\u2019t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!\u201d\r\n\r\nFrightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.\r\n\r\nThis done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor: close outside the fender.\r\n\r\nThey slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets.\r\n\r\n\u201cBarkers for me, Barney,\u201d said Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere they are,\u201d replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. \u201cYou loaded them yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right!\u201d replied Toby, stowing them away. \u201cThe persuaders?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got \u2019em,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cCrape, keys, centre-bits, darkies\u2014nothing forgotten?\u201d inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d rejoined his companion. \u201cBring them bits of timber, Barney. That\u2019s the time of day.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he took a thick stick from Barney\u2019s hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver\u2019s cape.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then!\u201d said Sikes, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nOliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake his other hand, Toby,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cLook out, Barney.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet. The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.\r\n\r\nIt was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver\u2019s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before. They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.\r\n\r\n\u201cSlap through the town,\u201d whispered Sikes; \u201cthere\u2019ll be nobody in the way, to-night, to see us.\u201d\r\n\r\nToby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night. But there was nobody abroad. They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.\r\n\r\nQuickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy next,\u201d said Toby. \u201cHoist him up; I\u2019ll catch hold of him.\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously towards the house.\r\n\r\nAnd now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up!\u201d murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket; \u201cGet up, or I\u2019ll strew your brains upon the grass.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! for God\u2019s sake let me go!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201clet me run away and die in the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy\u2019s mouth, and dragged him to the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d cried the man; \u201cit won\u2019t answer here. Say another word, and I\u2019ll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open. He\u2019s game enough now, I\u2019ll engage. I\u2019ve seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.\u201d\r\n\r\nSikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin\u2019s head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise. After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had referred, swung open on its hinges.\r\n\r\nIt was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing-place, at the end of the passage. The aperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver\u2019s size, nevertheless. A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike\u2019s art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow listen, you young limb,\u201d whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver\u2019s face; \u201cI\u2019m a going to put you through there. Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bolt at the top, you won\u2019t be able to reach,\u201d interposed Toby. \u201cStand upon one of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on \u2019em: which is the old lady\u2019s arms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep quiet, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes, with a threatening look. \u201cThe room-door is open, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWide,\u201d replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. \u201cThe game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who\u2019s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful. Ha! ha! Barney \u2019ticed him away to-night. So neat!\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake this lantern,\u201d said Sikes, looking into the room. \u201cYou see the stairs afore you?\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, \u201cYes.\u201d Sikes, pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead that instant.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s done in a minute,\u201d said Sikes, in the same low whisper. \u201cDirectly I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d whispered the other man.\r\n\r\nThey listened intently.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. \u201cNow!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome back!\u201d suddenly cried Sikes aloud. \u201cBack! back!\u201d\r\n\r\nScared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly.\r\n\r\nThe cry was repeated\u2014a light appeared\u2014a vision of two terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes\u2014a flash\u2014a loud noise\u2014a smoke\u2014a crash somewhere, but where he knew not,\u2014and he staggered back.\r\n\r\nSikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up.\r\n\r\n\u201cClasp your arm tighter,\u201d said Sikes, as he drew him through the window. \u201cGive me a shawl here. They\u2019ve hit him. Quick! How the boy bleeds!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace. And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy\u2019s heart; and he saw or heard no more.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nWHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS\r\n\r\nThe night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air. Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more bitter world.\r\n\r\nSuch was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,\u2014so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking reflectively at the fire; \u201cI\u2019m sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.\r\n\r\nHow slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrat the pot!\u201d said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on the hob; \u201ca little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! What use is it of, to anybody! Except,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, pausing, \u201cexcept to a poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never get another!\u201d said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; \u201cI shall never get another\u2014like him.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain. It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come in with you!\u201d said Mrs. Corney, sharply. \u201cSome of the old women dying, I suppose. They always die when I\u2019m at meals. Don\u2019t stand there, letting the cold air in, don\u2019t. What\u2019s amiss now, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, ma\u2019am, nothing,\u201d replied a man\u2019s voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, \u201cis that Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt your service, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other. \u201cShall I shut the door, ma\u2019am?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors. Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without permission.\r\n\r\n\u201cHard weather, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cHard, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cAnti-porochial weather this, ma\u2019am. We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble?\u201d said the matron, sipping her tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen, indeed, ma\u2019am!\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble. \u201cWhy here\u2019s one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight. Is he grateful, ma\u2019am? Is he grateful? Not a copper farthing\u2019s worth of it! What does he do, ma\u2019am, but ask for a few coals; if it\u2019s only a pocket handkerchief full, he says! Coals! What would he do with coals? Toast his cheese with \u2019em and then come back for more. That\u2019s the way with these people, ma\u2019am; give \u2019em a apron full of coals to-day, and they\u2019ll come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and the beadle went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201csee anything like the pitch it\u2019s got to. The day afore yesterday, a man\u2014you have been a married woman, ma\u2019am, and I may mention it to you\u2014a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer\u2019s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn\u2019t go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal. \u2018My heart!\u2019 says the ungrateful villain, \u2018what\u2019s the use of this to me? You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!\u2019 \u2018Very good,\u2019 says our overseer, taking \u2019em away again, \u2018you won\u2019t get anything else here.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll die in the streets!\u2019 says the vagrant. \u2018Oh no, you won\u2019t,\u2019 says our overseer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d interposed the matron. \u201cWell, Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined the beadle, \u201che went away; and he did die in the streets. There\u2019s a obstinate pauper for you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt beats anything I could have believed,\u201d observed the matron emphatically. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing, any way, Mr. Bumble? You\u2019re a gentleman of experience, and ought to know. Come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Corney,\u201d said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information, \u201cout-of-door relief, properly managed: properly managed, ma\u2019am: is the porochial safeguard. The great principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don\u2019t want; and then they get tired of coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Corney. \u201cWell, that is a good one, too!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Betwixt you and me, ma\u2019am,\u201d returned Mr. Bumble, \u201cthat\u2019s the great principle; and that\u2019s the reason why, if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you\u2019ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese. That\u2019s the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,\u201d said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, \u201cthese are official secrets, ma\u2019am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma\u2019am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt blows, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar, \u201cenough to cut one\u2019s ears off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether\u2014whether he wouldn\u2019t take a cup of tea?\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. Again Mr. Bumble coughed\u2014louder this time than he had coughed yet.\r\n\r\n\u201cSweet? Mr. Bumble?\u201d inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sweet, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe tea was made, and handed in silence. Mr. Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a cat, ma\u2019am, I see,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; \u201cand kittens too, I declare!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can\u2019t think,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cThey\u2019re so happy, so frolicsome, and so cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery nice animals, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; \u201cso very domestic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; \u201cso fond of their home too, that it\u2019s quite a pleasure, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Corney, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with his teaspoon, \u201cI mean to say this, ma\u2019am; that any cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma\u2019am, and not be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Bumble!\u201d remonstrated Mrs. Corney.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s of no use disguising facts, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive; \u201cI would drown it myself, with pleasure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019re a cruel man,\u201d said the matron vivaciously, as she held out her hand for the beadle\u2019s cup; \u201cand a very hard-hearted man besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHard-hearted, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cHard?\u201d Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney\u2019s little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble\u2019s part: he being in some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all.\r\n\r\nWhatever were Mr. Bumble\u2019s intentions, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped.\r\n\r\nNow, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble\u2019s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cHard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and looking up into the matron\u2019s face; \u201care you hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, \u201cwhat a very curious question from a single man. What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bumble!\u201d cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, \u201cMr. Bumble, I shall scream!\u201d Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm round the matron\u2019s waist.\r\n\r\nAs the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded who was there.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, mistress,\u201d said a withered old female pauper, hideously ugly: putting her head in at the door, \u201cOld Sally is a-going fast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s that to me?\u201d angrily demanded the matron. \u201cI can\u2019t keep her alive, can I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, mistress,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cnobody can; she\u2019s far beyond the reach of help. I\u2019ve seen a many people die; little babes and great strong men; and I know when death\u2019s a-coming, well enough. But she\u2019s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,\u2014and that\u2019s not often, for she is dying very hard,\u2014she says she has got something to tell, which you must hear. She\u2019ll never die quiet till you come, mistress.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn\u2019t even die without purposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back, lest anything particular should occur. Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble\u2019s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable. He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs, closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY\r\n\r\nIt was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron\u2019s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\nAlas! How few of Nature\u2019s faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven\u2019s surface clear. It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin\u2019s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay.\r\n\r\nIt was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end. There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary\u2019s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill.\r\n\r\n\u201cCold night, Mrs. Corney,\u201d said this young gentleman, as the matron entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery cold, indeed, sir,\u201d replied the mistress, in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should get better coals out of your contractors,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker; \u201cthese are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re the board\u2019s choosing, sir,\u201d returned the matron. \u201cThe least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient, \u201cit\u2019s all U.P. there, Mrs. Corney.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, is it, sir?\u201d asked the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick\u2019s point. \u201cIt\u2019s a break-up of the system altogether. Is she dozing, old lady?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps she\u2019ll go off in that way, if you don\u2019t make a row,\u201d said the young man. \u201cPut the light on the floor. She won\u2019t see it there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned. The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\nThe apothecary\u2019s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.\r\n\r\nWhen they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the heat. The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?\u201d inquired the messenger.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word,\u201d replied the other. \u201cShe plucked and tore at her arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She hasn\u2019t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. I ain\u2019t so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?\u201d demanded the first.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tried to get it down,\u201d rejoined the other. \u201cBut her teeth were tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again. So I drank it; and it did me good!\u201d\r\n\r\nLooking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mind the time,\u201d said the first speaker, \u201cwhen she would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, that she would,\u201d rejoined the other; \u201cshe had a merry heart. A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork. My old eyes have seen them\u2014ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.\u201d\r\n\r\nStretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into her own. While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait?\r\n\r\n\u201cNot long, mistress,\u201d replied the second woman, looking up into her face. \u201cWe have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience! He\u2019ll be here soon enough for us all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, you doting idiot!\u201d said the matron sternly. \u201cYou, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOften,\u201d answered the first woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut will never be again,\u201d added the second one; \u201cthat is, she\u2019ll never wake again but once\u2014and mind, mistress, that won\u2019t be for long!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLong or short,\u201d said the matron, snappishly, \u201cshe won\u2019t find me here when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing. It\u2019s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die, and I won\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans. If you make a fool of me again, I\u2019ll soon cure you, I warrant you!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, caused her to look round. The patient had raised herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she cried, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, hush!\u201d said one of the women, stooping over her. \u201cLie down, lie down!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll never lie down again alive!\u201d said the woman, struggling. \u201cI will tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.\r\n\r\n\u201cTurn them away,\u201d said the woman, drowsily; \u201cmake haste! make haste!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside. On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy. \u201cIn this very room\u2014in this very bed\u2014I once nursed a pretty young creetur\u2019, that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled with dust and blood. She gave birth to a boy, and died. Let me think\u2014what was the year again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind the year,\u201d said the impatient auditor; \u201cwhat about her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy,\u201d murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state, \u201cwhat about her?\u2014what about\u2014I know!\u201d she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head\u2014\u201cI robbed her, so I did! She wasn\u2019t cold\u2014I tell you she wasn\u2019t cold, when I stole it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStole what, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d cried the matron, with a gesture as if she would call for help.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt!\u201d replied the woman, laying her hand over the other\u2019s mouth. \u201cThe only thing she had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. It was gold, I tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGold!\u201d echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back. \u201cGo on, go on\u2014yes\u2014what of it? Who was the mother? When was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe charged me to keep it safe,\u201d replied the woman with a groan, \u201cand trusted me as the only woman about her. I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child\u2019s death, perhaps, is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they had known it all!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKnown what?\u201d asked the other. \u201cSpeak!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy grew so like his mother,\u201d said the woman, rambling on, and not heeding the question, \u201cthat I could never forget it when I saw his face. Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb! Wait; there\u2019s more to tell. I have not told you all, have I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman. \u201cBe quick, or it may be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mother,\u201d said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; \u201cthe mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named. \u2018And oh, kind Heaven!\u2019 she said, folding her thin hands together, \u2018whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy\u2019s name?\u201d demanded the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey called him Oliver,\u201d replied the woman, feebly. \u201cThe gold I stole was\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes\u2014what?\u201d cried the other.\r\n\r\nShe was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cStone dead!\u201d said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door was opened.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd nothing to tell, after all,\u201d rejoined the matron, walking carelessly away.\r\n\r\nThe two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the body.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nWHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY\r\n\r\nWhile these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den\u2014the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl\u2014brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.\r\n\r\nAt a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling\u2019s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour\u2019s cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors. He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company.\r\n\r\nMaster Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be \u201cblowed,\u201d or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling. It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s two doubles and the rub,\u201d said Mr. Chitling, with a very long face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket. \u201cI never see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. Even when we\u2019ve good cards, Charley and I can\u2019t make nothing of \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nEither the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cMatter, Fagin!\u201d cried Charley. \u201cI wish you had watched the play. Tommy Chitling hasn\u2019t won a point; and I went partners with him against the Artfull and dumb.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, ay!\u201d said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason. \u201cTry \u2019em again, Tom; try \u2019em again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more of it for me, thank \u2019ee, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling; \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. That \u2019ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there\u2019s no standing again\u2019 him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, \u201cyou must get up very early in the morning, to win against the Dodger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMorning!\u201d said Charley Bates; \u201cyou must put your boots on over-night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your shoulders, if you want to come over him.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow precious dull you are, Tommy!\u201d said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s thinking of, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow should I know, my dear?\u201d replied the Jew, looking round as he plied the bellows. \u201cAbout his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he\u2019s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. \u201cWhat do you say, Charley?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say,\u201d replied Master Bates, with a grin, \u201cthat he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he\u2019s a-blushing! Oh, my eye! here\u2019s a merry-go-rounder! Tommy Chitling\u2019s in love! Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a spree!\u201d\r\n\r\nThoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind him, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows. \u201cBetsy\u2019s a fine girl. Stick up to her, Tom. Stick up to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I mean to say, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, \u201cis, that that isn\u2019t anything to anybody here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more it is,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cCharley will talk. Don\u2019t mind him, my dear; don\u2019t mind him. Betsy\u2019s a fine girl. Do as she bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I do do as she bids me,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling; \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been milled, if it hadn\u2019t been for her advice. But it turned out a good job for you; didn\u2019t it, Fagin! And what\u2019s six weeks of it? It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don\u2019t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, to be sure, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind it again, Tom, would you,\u201d asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, \u201cif Bet was all right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean to say that I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Tom, angrily. \u201cThere, now. Ah! Who\u2019ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cnot a soul, Tom. I don\u2019t know one of \u2019em that would do it besides you; not one of \u2019em, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI might have got clear off, if I\u2019d split upon her; mightn\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. \u201cA word from me would have done it; wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure it would, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t blab it; did I, Fagin?\u201d demanded Tom, pouring question upon question with great volubility.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, to be sure,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cyou were too stout-hearted for that. A deal too stout, my dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I was,\u201d rejoined Tom, looking round; \u201cand if I was, what\u2019s to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.\r\n\r\n\u201cHark!\u201d cried the Dodger at this moment, \u201cI heard the tinkler.\u201d Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, \u201calone?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he had better not be funny just then. Having performed this friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew\u2019s face, and awaited his directions.\r\n\r\nThe old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and feared to know the worst. At length he raised his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; \u201cbring him down. Hush! Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was softly and immediately obeyed. There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you, Faguey?\u201d said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. \u201cPop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that\u2019s the time of day! You\u2019ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee there, Faguey,\u201d he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots; \u201cnot a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of blacking, by Jove! But don\u2019t look at me in that way, man. All in good time. I can\u2019t talk about business till I\u2019ve eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let\u2019s have a quiet fill-out for the first time these three days!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure.\r\n\r\nTo judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.\r\n\r\nHe looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. It was all of no use. Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said Toby.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he quietly resumed.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said the housebreaker, \u201chow\u2019s Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say\u2014\u201d began Toby, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cMean!\u201d cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. \u201cWhere are they? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe crack failed,\u201d said Toby faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it,\u201d replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it. \u201cWhat more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us\u2014straight as the crow flies\u2014through hedge and ditch. They gave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows! We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or dead, that\u2019s all I know about him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nIN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED\r\n\r\nThe old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit\u2019s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him back upon the pavement. Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at length emerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.\r\n\r\nNear to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets. Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse. It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny: visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they come. Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.\r\n\r\nIt was into this place that the Jew turned. He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child\u2019s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!\u201d said this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew\u2019s inquiry after his health.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,\u201d said Fagin, elevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,\u201d replied the trader; \u201cbut it soon cools down again; don\u2019t you find it so?\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the Cripples?\u201d inquired the man.\r\n\r\nThe Jew nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d pursued the merchant, reflecting. \u201cYes, there\u2019s some half-dozen of \u2019em gone in, that I knows. I don\u2019t think your friend\u2019s there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSikes is not, I suppose?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cNon istwentus, as the lawyers say,\u201d replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly. \u201cHave you got anything in my line to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to-night,\u201d said the Jew, turning away.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?\u201d cried the little man, calling after him. \u201cStop! I don\u2019t mind if I have a drop there with you!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively\u2019s presence. By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.\r\n\r\nThe Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured. Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person.\r\n\r\nThe room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded red, from being visible outside. The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more. By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner.\r\n\r\nAs Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could. When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman\u2019s right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group. There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was said\u2014and sharp ones, too. Near him were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness. Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked: others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.\r\n\r\nFagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?\u201d inquired the man, as he followed him out to the landing. \u201cWon\u2019t you join us? They\u2019ll be delighted, every one of \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, \u201cIs he here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd no news of Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone,\u201d replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. \u201cHe won\u2019t stir till it\u2019s all safe. Depend on it, they\u2019re on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he\u2019d blow upon the thing at once. He\u2019s all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. I\u2019ll pound it, that Barney\u2019s managing properly. Let him alone for that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill he be here to-night?\u201d asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonks, do you mean?\u201d inquired the landlord, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertain,\u201d replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; \u201cI expected him here before now. If you\u2019ll wait ten minutes, he\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his absence. \u201cTell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me to-night. No, say to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will be time enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d said the man. \u201cNothing more?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word now,\u201d said the Jew, descending the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse whisper; \u201cwhat a time this would be for a sell! I\u2019ve got Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! But it\u2019s not Phil Barker\u2019s time,\u201d said the Jew, looking up. \u201cPhil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives\u2014while they last. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe landlord reciprocated the old man\u2019s laugh; and returned to his guests. The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought. After a brief reflection, he called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green. He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes\u2019s residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, \u201cif there is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was in her room, the woman said. Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has been drinking,\u201d thought the Jew, cooly, \u201cor perhaps she is only miserable.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned, roused the girl. She eyed his crafty face narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit\u2019s story. When it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word. She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all.\r\n\r\nDuring the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned. Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone. At length he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most conciliatory tone,\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where should you think Bill was now, my dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the boy, too,\u201d said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face. \u201cPoor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe child,\u201d said the girl, suddenly looking up, \u201cis better where he is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, I do,\u201d returned the girl, meeting his gaze. \u201cI shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I can\u2019t bear to have him about me. The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh!\u201d said the Jew, scornfully. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I?\u201d cried the girl bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s no fault of yours, if I am not! You\u2019d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;\u2014the humour doesn\u2019t suit you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d rejoined the Jew, furiously. \u201cIt does not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cChange it, then!\u201d responded the girl, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cChange it!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion\u2019s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, \u201cI will change it! Listen to me, you drab. Listen to me, who with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull\u2019s throat between my fingers now. If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch. And do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d cried the girl involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d pursued Fagin, mad with rage. \u201cWhen the boy\u2019s worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPanting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour. A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy. After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNancy, dear!\u201d croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. \u201cDid you mind me, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry me now, Fagin!\u201d replied the girl, raising her head languidly. \u201cIf Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can\u2019t he won\u2019t; so no more about that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRegarding this boy, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy must take his chance with the rest,\u201d interrupted Nancy, hastily; \u201cand I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm\u2019s way, and out of yours,\u2014that is, if Bill comes to no harm. And if Toby got clear off, Bill\u2019s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill\u2019s worth two of Toby any time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd about what I was saying, my dear?\u201d observed the Jew, keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must say it all over again, if it\u2019s anything you want me to do,\u201d rejoined Nancy; \u201cand if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow. You put me up for a minute; but now I\u2019m stupid again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed. Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew\u2019s female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew\u2019s supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of \u201cNever say die!\u201d and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed.\r\n\r\nHaving eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table.\r\n\r\nIt was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin!\u201d whispered a voice close to his ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning quickly round, \u201cis that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d interrupted the stranger. \u201cI have been lingering here these two hours. Where the devil have you been?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn your business, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. \u201cOn your business all night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, of course!\u201d said the stranger, with a sneer. \u201cWell; and what\u2019s come of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing good,\u201d said the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing bad, I hope?\u201d said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a startled look on his companion.\r\n\r\nThe Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say, under cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him.\r\n\r\nFagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as dark as the grave,\u201d said the man, groping forward a few steps. \u201cMake haste!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShut the door,\u201d whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my doing,\u201d said the other man, feeling his way. \u201cThe wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short absence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one. Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can say the few words we\u2019ve got to say in here, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; \u201cand as there are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we\u2019ll set the candle on the stairs. There!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This done, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door. Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nThey conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation. They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks\u2014by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy\u2014said, raising his voice a little,\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you again, it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly hear him!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, do you mean to say you couldn\u2019t have done it, if you had chosen?\u201d demanded Monks, sternly. \u201cHaven\u2019t you done it, with other boys, scores of times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn\u2019t you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose turn would that have served, my dear?\u201d inquired the Jew humbly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMine,\u201d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not mine,\u201d said the Jew, submissively. \u201cHe might have become of use to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw it was not easy to train him to the business,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201che was not like other boys in the same circumstances.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCurse him, no!\u201d muttered the man, \u201cor he would have been a thief, long ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no hold upon him to make him worse,\u201d pursued the Jew, anxiously watching the countenance of his companion. \u201cHis hand was not in. I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the Dodger and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was not my doing,\u201d observed Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear!\u201d renewed the Jew. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for. Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then she begins to favour him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrottle the girl!\u201d said Monks, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, we can\u2019t afford to do that just now, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, smiling; \u201cand, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done. I know what these girls are, Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she\u2019ll care no more for him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief. If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,\u2014\u201cit\u2019s not likely, mind,\u2014but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no fault of mine if he is!\u201d interposed the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew\u2019s arm with trembling hands. \u201cMind that. Fagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told you from the first. I won\u2019t shed blood; it\u2019s always found out, and haunts a man besides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me? Fire this infernal den! What\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he sprung to his feet. \u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYonder!\u201d replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. \u201cThe shadow! I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like a breath!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room. The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed. It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces. They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fancy,\u201d said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw it!\u201d replied Monks, trembling. \u201cIt was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and, telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. They descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think now?\u201d said the Jew, when they had regained the passage. \u201cBesides ourselves, there\u2019s not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they\u2019re safe enough. See here!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.\r\n\r\nThis accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination. He declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one o\u2019clock. And so the amiable couple parted.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY\r\n\r\nAs it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words\u2014trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated\u2014hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands. Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies\u2019 beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney\u2019s approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney\u2019s chest of drawers.\r\n\r\nHaving listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.\r\n\r\nHe was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Corney,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, \u201cwhat is this, ma\u2019am? Has anything happened, ma\u2019am? Pray answer me: I\u2019m on\u2014on\u2014\u201d Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word \u201ctenterhooks,\u201d so he said \u201cbroken bottles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried the lady, \u201cI have been so dreadfully put out!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPut out, ma\u2019am!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble; \u201cwho has dared to\u2014? I know!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, \u201cthis is them wicious paupers!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s dreadful to think of!\u201d said the lady, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t think of it, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d whimpered the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen take something, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble soothingly. \u201cA little of the wine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for the world!\u201d replied Mrs. Corney. \u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u2014oh! The top shelf in the right-hand corner\u2014oh!\u201d Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady\u2019s lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m better now,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeppermint,\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke. \u201cTry it! There\u2019s a little\u2014a little something else in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very comforting,\u201d said Mrs. Corney.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney. \u201cI am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot weak, ma\u2019am,\u201d retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little closer. \u201cAre you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are all weak creeturs,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general principle.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we are,\u201d said the beadle.\r\n\r\nNothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney\u2019s chair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney\u2019s apron-string, round which it gradually became entwined.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are all weak creeturs,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t sigh, Mrs. Corney,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Mrs. Corney. And she sighed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very comfortable room, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble looking round. \u201cAnother room, and this, ma\u2019am, would be a complete thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be too much for one,\u201d murmured the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not for two, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. \u201cEh, Mrs. Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney\u2019s face. Mrs. Corney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe board allows you coals, don\u2019t they, Mrs. Corney?\u201d inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd candles,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoals, candles, and house-rent free,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cOh, Mrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. She sank into Mr. Bumble\u2019s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch porochial perfection!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. \u201cYou know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t live a week, the doctor says,\u201d pursued Mr. Bumble. \u201cHe is the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens! What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney sobbed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe little word?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty. \u201cThe one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYe\u2014ye\u2014yes!\u201d sighed out the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more,\u201d pursued the beadle; \u201ccompose your darling feelings for only one more. When is it to come off?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. At length summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble\u2019s neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was \u201ca irresistible duck.\u201d\r\n\r\nMatters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady\u2019s spirits. While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman\u2019s decease.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; \u201cI\u2019ll call at Sowerberry\u2019s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning. Was it that as frightened you, love?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything particular, dear,\u201d said the lady evasively.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must have been something, love,\u201d urged Mr. Bumble. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell your own B.?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now,\u201d rejoined the lady; \u201cone of these days. After we\u2019re married, dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter we\u2019re married!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any impudence from any of them male paupers as\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, love!\u201d interposed the lady, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I thought it was,\u201d continued Mr. Bumble; \u201cif I thought as any one of \u2019em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have dared to do it, love,\u201d responded the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey had better not!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. \u201cLet me see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him that he wouldn\u2019t do it a second time!\u201d\r\n\r\nUnembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady\u2019s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove.\r\n\r\nThe dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers\u2019 ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised.\r\n\r\nThe cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other. Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman\u2019s nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!\u201d said Charlotte; \u201ctry him, do; only this one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a delicious thing is a oyster!\u201d remarked Mr. Claypole, after he had swallowed it. \u201cWhat a pity it is, a number of \u2019em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn\u2019t it, Charlotte?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a cruelty,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced Mr. Claypole. \u201cAn\u2019t yer fond of oysters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot overmuch,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cI like to see you eat \u2019em, Noah dear, better than eating \u2019em myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLor!\u201d said Noah, reflectively; \u201chow queer!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave another,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cHere\u2019s one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t manage any more,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. Come here, Charlotte, and I\u2019ll kiss yer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. \u201cSay that again, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nCharlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. Mr. Claypole, without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cHow dare you mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him, you insolent minx? Kiss her!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation. \u201cFaugh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it!\u201d said Noah, blubbering. \u201cShe\u2019s always a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Noah,\u201d cried Charlotte, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer are; yer know yer are!\u201d retorted Noah. \u201cShe\u2019s always a-doin\u2019 of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. \u201cTake yourself downstairs, ma\u2019am. Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman\u2019s shell after breakfast to-morrow morning. Do you hear sir? Kissing!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his hands. \u201cThe sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful! If Parliament don\u2019t take their abominable courses under consideration, this country\u2019s ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!\u201d With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker\u2019s premises.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman\u2019s funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nLOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\u201cWolves tear your throats!\u201d muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. \u201cI wish I was among some of you; you\u2019d howl the hoarser for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers.\r\n\r\nThere was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, you white-livered hound!\u201d cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead. \u201cStop!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.\r\n\r\n\u201cBear a hand with the boy,\u201d cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his confederate. \u201cCome back!\u201d\r\n\r\nToby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuicker!\u201d cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t play booty with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the noise grew louder. Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all up, Bill!\u201d cried Toby; \u201cdrop the kid, and show \u2019em your heels.\u201d With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed. Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cHo, ho, there!\u201d cried a tremulous voice in the rear. \u201cPincher! Neptune! Come here, come here!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command. Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy advice, or, leastways, I should say, my orders, is,\u201d said the fattest man of the party, \u201cthat we \u2019mediately go home again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,\u201d said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,\u201d said the third, who had called the dogs back, \u201cMr. Giles ought to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d replied the shorter man; \u201cand whatever Mr. Giles says, it isn\u2019t our place to contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.\u201d To tell the truth, the little man did seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are afraid, Brittles,\u201d said Mr. Giles.\r\n\r\n\u201cI an\u2019t,\u201d said Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are,\u201d said Giles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,\u201d said Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lie, Brittles,\u201d said Mr. Giles.\r\n\r\nNow, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles\u2019s taunt; and Mr. Giles\u2019s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cwe\u2019re all afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the party.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I do,\u201d replied the man. \u201cIt\u2019s natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances. I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d said Brittles; \u201conly there\u2019s no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that he was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, \u201cwhat a man will do, when his blood is up. I should have committed murder\u2014I know I should\u2014if we\u2019d caught one of them rascals.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what it was,\u201d said Mr. Giles; \u201cit was the gate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder if it was,\u201d exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may depend upon it,\u201d said Giles, \u201cthat that gate stopped the flow of the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit. Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.\r\n\r\nEncouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire. Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne.\r\n\r\nThe air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke. The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning. Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him.\r\n\r\nMorning drew on apace. The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue\u2014the death of night, rather than the birth of day\u2014glimmered faintly in the sky. The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes. The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes. But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay.\r\n\r\nAt length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood. He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man. But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither.\r\n\r\nAnd now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing\u2014for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber\u2019s grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.\r\n\r\nThus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road. Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him.\r\n\r\nHe looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it.\r\n\r\nAs he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.\r\n\r\nThat garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men\u2019s mercy. It was the very house they had attempted to rob.\r\n\r\nOliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight. Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly? He pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges. He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.\r\n\r\nIt happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr. Giles\u2019s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society. But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was about half-past two,\u201d said Mr. Giles, \u201cor I wouldn\u2019t swear that it mightn\u2019t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014Heerd a noise,\u201d continued Mr. Giles. \u201cI says, at first, \u2018This is illusion\u2019; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of a noise?\u201d asked the cook.\r\n\r\n\u201cA kind of a busting noise,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMore like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,\u201d suggested Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was, when you heerd it, sir,\u201d rejoined Mr. Giles; \u201cbut, at this time, it had a busting sound. I turned down the clothes\u201d; continued Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, \u201csat up in bed; and listened.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated \u201cLor!\u201d and drew their chairs closer together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI heerd it now, quite apparent,\u201d resumed Mr. Giles. \u201c\u2018Somebody,\u2019 I says, \u2018is forcing of a door, or window; what\u2019s to be done? I\u2019ll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,\u2019 I says, \u2018may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nHere, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tossed off the clothes,\u201d said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, \u201cgot softly out of bed; drew on a pair of\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLadies present, Mr. Giles,\u201d murmured the tinker.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014Of shoes, sir,\u201d said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word; \u201cseized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room. \u2018Brittles,\u2019 I says, when I had woke him, \u2018don\u2019t be frightened!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you did,\u201d observed Brittles, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019re dead men, I think, Brittles,\u2019 I says,\u201d continued Giles; \u201c\u2018but don\u2019t be frightened.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he frightened?\u201d asked the cook.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr. Giles. \u201cHe was as firm\u2014ah! pretty near as firm as I was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should have died at once, I\u2019m sure, if it had been me,\u201d observed the housemaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a woman,\u201d retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrittles is right,\u201d said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly; \u201cfrom a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle\u2019s hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark,\u2014as it might be so.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair. The cook and housemaid screamed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a knock,\u201d said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. \u201cOpen the door, somebody.\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,\u201d said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him, and looking very blank himself; \u201cbut the door must be opened. Do you hear, somebody?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep. The women were out of the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,\u201d said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, \u201cI am ready to make one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nBrittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs\u2019 tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely.\r\n\r\nThese precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker\u2019s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and gave the word of command to open the door. Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other\u2019s shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion.\r\n\r\n\u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the\u2014eh?\u2014Why\u2014Brittles\u2014look here\u2014don\u2019t you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere he is!\u201d bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; \u201chere\u2019s one of the thieves, ma\u2019am! Here\u2019s a thief, miss! Wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014In a lantern, miss,\u201d cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.\r\n\r\nThe two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged. In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.\r\n\r\n\u201cGiles!\u201d whispered the voice from the stair-head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here, miss,\u201d replied Mr. Giles. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, miss; I ain\u2019t much injured. He didn\u2019t make a very desperate resistance, miss! I was soon too many for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d replied the young lady; \u201cyou frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWounded desperate, miss,\u201d replied Giles, with indescribable complacency.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looks as if he was a-going, miss,\u201d bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, pray; there\u2019s a good man!\u201d rejoined the lady. \u201cWait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away. She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles\u2019s room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut won\u2019t you take one look at him, first, miss?\u201d asked Mr. Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had skilfully brought down. \u201cNot one little peep, miss?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now, for the world,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cPoor fellow! Oh! treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then, bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nHAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED\r\n\r\nIn a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.\r\n\r\nOf the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her. Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.\r\n\r\nThe younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God\u2019s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers.\r\n\r\nShe was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness.\r\n\r\nShe was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?\u201d asked the old lady, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn hour and twelve minutes, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is always slow,\u201d remarked the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrittles always was a slow boy, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the attendant. And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gets worse instead of better, I think,\u201d said the elder lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,\u201d said the young lady, smiling.\r\n\r\nMr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never heard of such a thing!\u201d exclaimed the fat gentleman. \u201cMy dear Mrs. Maylie\u2014bless my soul\u2014in the silence of the night, too\u2014I never heard of such a thing!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,\u201d said the fat gentleman. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I\u2019m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So unexpected! In the silence of the night, too!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you, Miss Rose,\u201d said the doctor, turning to the young lady, \u201cI\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! very much so, indeed,\u201d said Rose, interrupting him; \u201cbut there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! to be sure,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cso there is. That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.\r\n\r\n\u201cHonour, eh?\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know; perhaps it\u2019s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you\u2019ve fought a duel, Giles.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party.\r\n\r\n\u201cGad, that\u2019s true!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cWhere is he? Show me the way. I\u2019ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That\u2019s the little window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn\u2019t have believed it!\u201d\r\n\r\nTalking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as \u201cthe doctor,\u201d had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above. At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,\u201d said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is not in danger, I hope?\u201d said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that would not be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cthough I don\u2019t think he is. Have you seen the thief?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the old lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor heard anything about him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Mr. Giles; \u201cbut I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage.\r\n\r\n\u201cRose wished to see the man,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHumph!\u201d rejoined the doctor. \u201cThere is nothing very alarming in his appearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it be necessary,\u201d replied the old lady, \u201ccertainly not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I think it is necessary,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cat all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me\u2014Miss Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!\u201d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nRELATES WHAT OLIVER\u2019S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM\r\n\r\nWith many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady\u2019s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door, \u201clet us hear what you think of him. He has not been shaved very recently, but he don\u2019t look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting order.\u201d\r\n\r\nStepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow.\r\n\r\nThe honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver\u2019s hair from his face. As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can this mean?\u201d exclaimed the elder lady. \u201cThis poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVice,\u201d said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, \u201ctakes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shall not enshrine her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut at so early an age!\u201d urged Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear young lady,\u201d rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head; \u201ccrime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone. The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, can you\u2014oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut even if he has been wicked,\u201d pursued Rose, \u201cthink how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother\u2019s love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy\u2019s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment. Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear love,\u201d said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, \u201cdo you think I would harm a hair of his head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Rose, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, surely,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cmy days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save him, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me think, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the doctor; \u201clet me think.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of \u201cI\u2019ve got it now\u201d and \u201cno, I haven\u2019t,\u201d and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cI think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don\u2019t object to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnless there is some other way of preserving the child,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no other,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNo other, take my word for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen my aunt invests you with full power,\u201d said Rose, smiling through her tears; \u201cbut pray don\u2019t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to think,\u201d retorted the doctor, \u201cthat everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,\u201d returned Rose, blushing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, laughing heartily, \u201cthat is no very difficult matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn\u2019t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger. Now I make this stipulation\u2014that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, aunt!\u201d entreated Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, aunt!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIs is a bargain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe cannot be hardened in vice,\u201d said Rose; \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d retorted the doctor; \u201cthen so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.\r\n\r\nThe patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nThe conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men\u2019s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day\u2019s life brings with it!\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur.\r\n\r\nThe momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles. And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.\r\n\r\nThere were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable. The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale\u2014as indeed he had.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit still!\u201d said the doctor, waving his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles. \u201cMisses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among \u2019em here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles\u2019s condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the patient to-night, sir?\u201d asked Giles.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo-so\u201d; returned the doctor. \u201cI am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mean to say, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, trembling, \u201cthat he\u2019s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn\u2019t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d said the doctor, mysteriously. \u201cMr. Giles, are you a Protestant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I hope so,\u201d faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are you, boy?\u201d said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles.\r\n\r\n\u201cLord bless me, sir!\u201d replied Brittles, starting violently; \u201cI\u2019m the same as Mr. Giles, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen tell me this,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cboth of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it! Come! We are prepared for you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cPay attention to the reply, constable, will you?\u201d said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy\u2019s utmost acuteness. \u201cSomething may come of this before long.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question of identity, you will observe,\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it is, sir,\u201d replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the house broken into,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cand a couple of men catch one moment\u2019s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here\u2019s a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him\u2014by doing which, they place his life in great danger\u2014and swear he is the thief. Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn\u2019t law, he would be glad to know what was.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask you again,\u201d thundered the doctor, \u201care you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the runners!\u201d cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bow Street officers, sir,\u201d replied Brittles, taking up a candle; \u201cme and Mr. Giles sent for \u2019em this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Brittles; \u201cI sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren\u2019t here before, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did, did you? Then confound your\u2014slow coaches down here; that\u2019s all,\u201d said the doctor, walking away.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nINVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen the door,\u201d replied a man outside; \u201cit\u2019s the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nMuch comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?\u201d said the officer; \u201che\u2019s in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you got a coach \u2019us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?\u201d\r\n\r\nBrittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were.\r\n\r\nThe man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?\u201d said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table. \u201cOh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the lady of the house,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\nMr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it\u2014one of the two\u2014seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, with regard to this here robbery, master,\u201d said Blathers. \u201cWhat are the circumstances?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,\u201d said Blathers; \u201cbut my opinion at once is,\u2014I don\u2019t mind committing myself to that extent,\u2014that this wasn\u2019t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?\u201d said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, master,\u201d replied Blathers. \u201cThis is all about the robbery, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll,\u201d replied the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?\u201d said Blathers.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing at all,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cOne of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it\u2019s nonsense: sheer absurdity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWery easy disposed of, if it is,\u201d remarked Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat he says is quite correct,\u201d observed Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets. \u201cWho is the boy? What account does he give of himself? Where did he come from? He didn\u2019t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies. \u201cI know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d rejoined Mr. Blathers. \u201cWe had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That\u2019s the usual way of doing business.\u201d\r\n\r\nLights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with. This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night\u2019s adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child\u2019s play.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon my word,\u201d he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, \u201cI hardly know what to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said Rose, \u201cthe poor child\u2019s story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI doubt it, my dear young lady,\u201d said the doctor, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would say? A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou believe it, surely?\u201d interrupted Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,\u201d rejoined the doctor; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d demanded Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, my pretty cross-examiner,\u201d replied the doctor: \u201cbecause, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well. Confound the fellows, they will have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman\u2019s pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman\u2019s house, to a place which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don\u2019t you see all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it, of course,\u201d replied Rose, smiling at the doctor\u2019s impetuosity; \u201cbut still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cof course not! Bless the bright eyes of your sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe more I think of it,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthe more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy\u2019s real story. I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! what is to be done?\u201d cried Rose. \u201cDear, dear! why did they send for these people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. \u201cI would not have had them here, for the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll I know is,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, \u201cthat we must try and carry it off with a bold face. The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that\u2019s one comfort. We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, master,\u201d said Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. \u201cThis warn\u2019t a put-up thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what the devil\u2019s a put-up thing?\u201d demanded the doctor, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe call it a put-up robbery, ladies,\u201d said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor\u2019s, \u201cwhen the servants is in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody suspected them, in this case,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cWery likely not, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Blathers; \u201cbut they might have been in it, for all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore likely on that wery account,\u201d said Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe find it was a town hand,\u201d said Blathers, continuing his report; \u201cfor the style of work is first-rate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWery pretty indeed it is,\u201d remarked Duff, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was two of \u2019em in it,\u201d continued Blathers; \u201cand they had a boy with \u2019em; that\u2019s plain from the size of the window. That\u2019s all to be said at present. We\u2019ll see this lad that you\u2019ve got upstairs at once, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?\u201d said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! to be sure!\u201d exclaimed Rose, eagerly. \u201cYou shall have it immediately, if you will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you, miss!\u201d said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth; \u201cit\u2019s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that\u2019s handy, miss; don\u2019t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard.\r\n\r\n\u201cA little drop of spirits, master, if it\u2019s all the same,\u201d replied Blathers. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold ride from London, ma\u2019am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; \u201cI have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,\u201d said Mr. Duff, assisting his colleague\u2019s memory.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was something in this way, warn\u2019t it?\u201d rejoined Mr. Blathers; \u201cthat was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou always gave that to him\u201d replied Duff. \u201cIt was the Family Pet, I tell you. Conkey hadn\u2019t any more to do with it than I had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d retorted Mr. Blathers; \u201cI know better. Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was! Better than any novel-book I ever see!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,\u201d said Blathers. \u201cThis here Conkey Chickweed\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConkey means Nosey, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Duff.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course the lady knows that, don\u2019t she?\u201d demanded Mr. Blathers. \u201cAlways interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I\u2019ve seen \u2019em off\u2019en. He warn\u2019t one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high. He was wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about \u2019em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost \u2019em. However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\u2019t know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house. \u2018I see him, Spyers,\u2019 said Chickweed, \u2018pass my house yesterday morning,\u2019 \u2018Why didn\u2019t you up, and collar him!\u2019 says Spyers. \u2018I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\u2019 says the poor man; \u2018but we\u2019re sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o\u2019clock at night he passed again.\u2019 Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment\u2019s notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, \u2018Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!\u2019 Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry. Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, \u2018Thieves!\u2019 and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \u2018Which is the man?\u2019 \u2018D\u2014me!\u2019 says Chickweed, \u2018I\u2019ve lost him again!\u2019 It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn\u2019t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again. At last, he couldn\u2019t help shutting \u2019em, to ease \u2019em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a-roaring out, \u2018Here he is!\u2019 Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday\u2019s one, the man\u2019s lost again! This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did Jem Spyers say?\u201d inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story.\r\n\r\n\u201cJem Spyers,\u201d resumed the officer, \u201cfor a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says \u2018Chickweed, I\u2019ve found out who done this here robbery.\u2019 \u2018Have you?\u2019 said Chickweed. \u2018Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!\u2019 \u2018Come!\u2019 said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, \u2018none of that gammon! You did it yourself.\u2019 So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he hadn\u2019t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!\u201d said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery curious, indeed,\u201d observed the doctor. \u201cNow, if you please, you can walk upstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver\u2019s bedroom; Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle.\r\n\r\nOliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward\u2014in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, \u201cthis is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d\u2019 ye-call-him\u2019s grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.\u201d\r\n\r\nMessrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended to their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to deny that, I suppose?\u201d said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all done for the\u2014for the best, sir,\u201d answered Giles. \u201cI am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn\u2019t have meddled with him. I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThought it was what boy?\u201d inquired the senior officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe housebreaker\u2019s boy, sir!\u201d replied Giles. \u201cThey\u2014they certainly had a boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell? Do you think so now?\u201d inquired Blathers.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink what, now?\u201d replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink it\u2019s the same boy, Stupid-head?\u201d rejoined Blathers, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; I really don\u2019t know,\u201d said Giles, with a rueful countenance. \u201cI couldn\u2019t swear to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked Mr. Blathers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d replied poor Giles. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is the boy; indeed, I\u2019m almost certain that it isn\u2019t. You know it can\u2019t be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas this man been a-drinking, sir?\u201d inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a precious muddle-headed chap you are!\u201d said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt.\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne had been feeling the patient\u2019s pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.\r\n\r\nActing upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn\u2019t know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty.\r\n\r\nAmong other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning.\r\n\r\nWith the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King\u2019s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went.\r\n\r\nIn short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver\u2019s appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven\u2014and if they be not, what prayers are!\u2014the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nOF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS\r\n\r\nOliver\u2019s ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips; \u201cyou shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us. The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days. We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe trouble!\u201d cried Oliver. \u201cOh! dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall give nothing at all,\u201d said Miss Maylie, smiling; \u201cfor, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHappy, ma\u2019am!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201chow kind of you to say so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will make me happier than I can tell you,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cTo think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine. Do you understand me?\u201d she inquired, watching Oliver\u2019s thoughtful face.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, ma\u2019am, yes!\u201d replied Oliver eagerly; \u201cbut I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo whom?\u201d inquired the young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,\u201d rejoined Oliver. \u201cIf they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure they would,\u201d rejoined Oliver\u2019s benefactress; \u201cand Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he, ma\u2019am?\u201d cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition. One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the boy?\u201d cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle. \u201cDo you see anything\u2014hear anything\u2014feel anything\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat, sir,\u201d cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. \u201cThat house!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here,\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cWhat of the house, my man; eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thieves\u2014the house they took me to!\u201d whispered Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe devil it is!\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cHallo, there! let me out!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalloa?\u201d said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMatter!\u201d exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment\u2019s reflection. \u201cA good deal. Robbery is the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be Murder the matter, too,\u201d replied the hump-backed man, coolly, \u201cif you don\u2019t take your hands off. Do you hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014confound the fellow, what\u2019s his rascally name\u2014Sikes; that\u2019s it. Where\u2019s Sikes, you thief?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor\u2019s grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house. Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley.\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered Oliver\u2019s description!\r\n\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, \u201cwhat do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?\u201d said the irritable doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d demanded the hunchback. \u201cWill you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs soon as I think proper,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver\u2019s account of it. \u201cI shall find you out, some day, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you?\u201d sneered the ill-favoured cripple. \u201cIf you ever want me, I\u2019m here. I haven\u2019t lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty years, to be scared by you. You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.\u201d And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cStupid enough, this,\u201d muttered the doctor to himself; \u201cthe boy must have made a mistake. Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.\u201d With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards. He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am an ass!\u201d said the doctor, after a long silence. \u201cDid you know that before, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen don\u2019t forget it another time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn ass,\u201d said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes. \u201cEven if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though. I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse. It might have done me good.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him. If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver\u2019s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any. He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver\u2019s replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth.\r\n\r\nAs Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither. When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my boy, which house is it?\u201d inquired Mr. Losberne.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat! That!\u201d replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. \u201cThe white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cYou will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! I hope so!\u201d cried Oliver. \u201cThey were so good to me; so very, very good to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.\r\n\r\nAlas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. \u201cTo Let.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKnock at the next door,\u201d cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver\u2019s arm in his. \u201cWhat has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe servant did not know; but would go and inquire. She presently returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before. Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas his housekeeper gone too?\u201d inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment\u2019s pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir\u201d; replied the servant. \u201cThe old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow\u2019s, all went together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen turn towards home again,\u201d said Mr. Losberne to the driver; \u201cand don\u2019t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded London!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe book-stall keeper, sir?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI know the way there. See him, pray, sir! Do see him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cQuite enough for both of us. If we go to the book-stall keeper\u2019s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away. No; home again straight!\u201d And in obedience to the doctor\u2019s impulse, home they went.\r\n\r\nThis bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber\u2014a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day\u2014was almost more than he could bear.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his benefactors. After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months.\r\n\r\nSending the plate, which had so excited Fagin\u2019s cupidity, to the banker\u2019s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them.\r\n\r\nWho can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts! Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature\u2019s face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely spot to which they repaired. Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there. The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours. Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest. Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts. Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him. Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it. When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear. There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture.\r\n\r\nAnd when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time! There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver\u2019s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before. Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o\u2019clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie\u2019s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her appearance: when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.\r\n\r\nSo three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver\u2019s were true felicity. With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nWHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK\r\n\r\nSpring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness. The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond. The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.\r\n\r\nStill, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people. He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing. Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds. Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home. The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual. After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.\r\n\r\n\u201cRose, my dear!\u201d said the elder lady.\r\n\r\nRose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cRose, my love!\u201d cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her. \u201cWhat is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, aunt; nothing,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is; I can\u2019t describe it; but I feel\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot ill, my love?\u201d interposed Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no! Oh, not ill!\u201d replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; \u201cI shall be better presently. Close the window, pray!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child!\u201d said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, \u201cI never saw you so before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would not alarm you if I could avoid it,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cbut indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I am ill, aunt.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before. Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye. Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale.\r\n\r\nOliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, \u201cthat nothing is the matter? She don\u2019t look well to-night, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length, she said, in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d inquired Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe heavy blow,\u201d said the old lady, \u201cof losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! God forbid!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmen to that, my child!\u201d said the old lady, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cTwo hours ago, she was quite well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is very ill now,\u201d rejoined Mrs. Maylies; \u201cand will be worse, I am sure. My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd consider, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. \u201cOh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her. I am sure\u2014certain\u2014quite certain\u2014that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not die. Heaven will never let her die so young.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver\u2019s head. \u201cYou think like a child, poor boy. But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love. I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy. God\u2019s will be done! I love her; and He knows how well!\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm. He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully. But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances. How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves?\r\n\r\nAn anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie\u2019s predictions were but too well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face; \u201cthis letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr. Losberne. It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is another letter,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; \u201cbut whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know. I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it for Chertsey, too, ma\u2019am?\u201d inquired Oliver; impatient to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord\u2019s house in the country; where, he could not make out.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall it go, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. \u201cI will wait until to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.\r\n\r\nSwiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.\r\n\r\nHere he paused, and looked about for the inn. There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of \u201cThe George.\u201d To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage. At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nAs it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter heart. He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door.\r\n\r\n\u201cHah!\u201d cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling. \u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver; \u201cI was in a great hurry to get home, and didn\u2019t see you were coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeath!\u201d muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes. \u201cWho would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He\u2019d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man\u2019s wild look. \u201cI hope I have not hurt you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRot you!\u201d murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth; \u201cif I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night. Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp! What are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.\r\n\r\nOliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.\r\n\r\nRose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was delirious. A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave\u2019s verge!\r\n\r\nOh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them!\r\n\r\nMorning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside. Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived. \u201cIt is hard,\u201d said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; \u201cso young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother morning. The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast. Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.\r\n\r\nThere was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds.\r\n\r\nA knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts. Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young. They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother\u2014a mother once\u2014among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on.\r\n\r\nOliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. He had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been. We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done\u2014of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired! There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour. Oliver\u2019s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away. He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die.\r\n\r\nThey sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure. Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep. They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of Rose?\u201d cried the old lady. \u201cTell me at once! I can bear it; anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must compose yourself,\u201d said the doctor supporting her. \u201cBe calm, my dear ma\u2019am, pray.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me go, in God\u2019s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is dying!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried the doctor, passionately. \u201cAs He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nCONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER\r\n\r\nIt was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.\r\n\r\nThe night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber. As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. Looking round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him.\r\n\r\nAs it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person. In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses. Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried the voice. \u201cOliver, what\u2019s the news? Miss Rose! Master O-li-ver!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it you, Giles?\u201d cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.\r\n\r\nGiles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cBetter or worse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter\u2014much better!\u201d replied Oliver, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank Heaven!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman. \u201cYou are sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cThe change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?\u201d demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice. \u201cDo not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would not for the world, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cIndeed you may believe me. Mr. Losberne\u2019s words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come. I heard him say so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tears stood in Oliver\u2019s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes. Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark\u2014for he could well guess what his feelings were\u2014and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots. That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you had better go on to my mother\u2019s in the chaise, Giles,\u201d said he. \u201cI would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her. You can say I am coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,\u201d said Giles: giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; \u201cbut if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. It wouldn\u2019t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, \u201cyou can do as you like. Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of the chaise. This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.\r\n\r\nAs they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing. Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother!\u201d whispered the young man; \u201cwhy did you not write before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie; \u201cbut, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne\u2019s opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why,\u201d said the young man, \u201cwhy run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? If Rose had\u2014I cannot utter that word now\u2014if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that had been the case, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cI fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who can wonder if it be so, mother?\u201d rejoined the young man; \u201cor why should I say, if?\u2014It is\u2014it is\u2014you know it, mother\u2014you must know it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie; \u201cI know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting. If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is unkind, mother,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, my dear son,\u201d returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder, \u201cthat youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting. Above all, I think\u201d said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son\u2019s face, \u201cthat if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life. And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d said the young man, impatiently, \u201che would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so now, Harry,\u201d replied his mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd ever will!\u201d said the young man. \u201cThe mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind. Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cit is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet it rest with Rose, then,\u201d interposed Harry. \u201cYou will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not,\u201d rejoined Mrs. Maylie; \u201cbut I would have you consider\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have considered!\u201d was the impatient reply; \u201cMother, I have considered, years and years. I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection. My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe shall,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,\u201d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot coldly,\u201d rejoined the old lady; \u201cfar from it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow then?\u201d urged the young man. \u201cShe has formed no other attachment?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d replied his mother; \u201cyou have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her affections already. What I would say,\u201d resumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, \u201cis this. Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose\u2019s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I leave you to discover,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie. \u201cI must go back to her. God bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall see you again to-night?\u201d said the young man, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy and by,\u201d replied the lady; \u201cwhen I leave Rose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell her I am here?\u201d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I long to see her. You will not refuse to do this, mother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI will tell her all.\u201d And pressing her son\u2019s hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them. The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient\u2019s situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver\u2019s statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?\u201d inquired the doctor, when he had concluded.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing particular, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cI am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe boy is very well, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone of patronage; \u201cand sends his respectful duty, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cSeeing you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness. The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit. At this, the two women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, \u201cNo, no\u201d; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so. And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.\r\n\r\nAbove stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman\u2019s good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.\r\n\r\nOliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days. The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind. If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed. The window of the young lady\u2019s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning. Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning\u2019s walk. Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.\r\n\r\nNor did Oliver\u2019s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself. It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house. It was quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume. It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood. There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books. He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two. Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the mere silent presence of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.\r\n\r\nOliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep. Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew\u2019s house again. There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush, my dear!\u201d he thought he heard the Jew say; \u201cit is he, sure enough. Come away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe!\u201d the other man seemed to answer; \u201ccould I mistake him, think you? If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn\u2019t a mark above it, that he lay buried there?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up.\r\n\r\nGood Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There\u2014there\u2014at the window\u2014close before him\u2014so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard.\r\n\r\nIt was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone. But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nCONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER\u2019S ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\r\n\r\nWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver\u2019s cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, \u201cThe Jew! the Jew!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver\u2019s history from his mother, understood it at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat direction did he take?\u201d he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; \u201cI missed them in an instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, they are in the ditch!\u201d said Harry. \u201cFollow! And keep as near me, as you can.\u201d So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him.\r\n\r\nGiles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.\r\n\r\nOn they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles. There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must have been a dream, Oliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, indeed, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch\u2019s countenance; \u201cI saw him too plainly for that. I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was the other?\u201d inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cWe had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey took this way?\u201d demanded Harry: \u201care you sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I am that the men were at the window,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the meadow. \u201cThe tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen watched Oliver\u2019s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men\u2019s shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is strange!\u201d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cStrange?\u201d echoed the doctor. \u201cBlathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance. Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers. Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless. After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all.\r\n\r\nBut, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark. Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides.\r\n\r\nAt length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\u201cA few\u2014a very few\u2014will suffice, Rose,\u201d said the young man, drawing his chair towards her. \u201cWhat I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014ought to have left here, before,\u201d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should, indeed,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cForgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,\u201d said the young man; \u201cthe fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven. We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.\r\n\r\n\u201cA creature,\u201d continued the young man, passionately, \u201ca creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God\u2019s own angels, fluttered between life and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you\u2014these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course. You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide. I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not mean that,\u201d said Rose, weeping; \u201cI only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,\u201d said the young man, taking her hand. \u201cRose, my own dear Rose! For years\u2014for years\u2014I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy\u2019s attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us! That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour behaviour has ever been kind and noble.\u201d said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated. \u201cAs you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d replied Rose, \u201cthat you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love. Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears. Harry still retained the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your reasons, Rose,\u201d he said, at length, in a low voice; \u201cyour reasons for this decision?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a right to know them,\u201d rejoined Rose. \u201cYou can say nothing to alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Harry. I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects. I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your inclinations chime with your sense of duty\u2014\u201d Harry began.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey do not,\u201d replied Rose, colouring deeply.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you return my love?\u201d said Harry. \u201cSay but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,\u201d rejoined Rose, \u201cI could have\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave received this declaration very differently?\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could,\u201d said Rose. \u201cStay!\u201d she added, disengaging her hand, \u201cwhy should we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it will be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness. Farewell, Harry! As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother word, Rose,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYour reason in your own words. From your own lips, let me hear it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe prospect before you,\u201d answered Rose, firmly, \u201cis a brilliant one. All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother\u2019s place. In a word,\u201d said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, \u201cthere is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads. I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!\u201d cried Harry, throwing himself before her. \u201cIf I had been less\u2014less fortunate, the world would call it\u2014if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny\u2014if I had been poor, sick, helpless\u2014would you have turned from me then? Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not press me to reply,\u201d answered Rose. \u201cThe question does not arise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,\u201d retorted Harry, \u201cit will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me. It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, if your lot had been differently cast,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cif you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial. I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.\u201d\r\n\r\nBusy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,\u201d said Rose, extending her hand. \u201cI must leave you now, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask one promise,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnce, and only once more,\u2014say within a year, but it may be much sooner,\u2014I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to press me to alter my right determination,\u201d replied Rose, with a melancholy smile; \u201cit will be useless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry; \u201cto hear you repeat it, if you will\u2014finally repeat it! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let it be so,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cit is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand again. But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nIS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?\u201d said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast-table. \u201cWhy, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell me a different tale one of these days,\u201d said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope I may have good cause to do so,\u201d replied Mr. Losberne; \u201cthough I confess I don\u2019t think I shall. But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London. And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too bad, isn\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fine fellow,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cyou shall come and see me when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe great nobs,\u201d replied Harry, \u201cunder which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cyou are a queer fellow. But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life. There\u2019s something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.\u201d\r\n\r\nHarry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying, \u201cWe shall see,\u201d and pursued the subject no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, \u201clet me speak a word with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can write well now?\u201d said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me\u2014say once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London. Will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,\u201d exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to know how\u2014how my mother and Miss Maylie are,\u201d said the young man; \u201cand you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she\u2014they, I mean\u2014seem happy and quite well. You understand me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! quite, sir, quite,\u201d replied Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would rather you did not mention it to them,\u201d said Harry, hurrying over his words; \u201cbecause it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrive on!\u201d he cried, \u201chard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHalloa!\u201d cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; \u201csomething very short of flying will keep pace with me. Do you hear?\u201d\r\n\r\nJingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted. It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.\r\n\r\nAnd there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems in high spirits and happy,\u201d she said, at length. \u201cI feared for a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very glad.\u201d\r\n\r\nTears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose\u2019s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nIN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface. A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance. Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Bumble\u2019s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs. The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not the breeches. The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like the coat, but, oh how different! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one. Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle.\r\n\r\nThere are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them. A field-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat. Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they? Men. Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse. Another beadle had come into power. On him the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd to-morrow two months it was done!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh. \u201cIt seems a age.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh\u2014there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cI sold myself,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection, \u201cfor six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. I went very reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCheap!\u201d cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble\u2019s ear: \u201cyou would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bumble, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d cried the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave the goodness to look at me,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she stands such a eye as that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble to himself, \u201cshe can stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers. If it fails with her, my power is gone.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion. The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble\u2019s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed. He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to sit snoring there, all day?\u201d inquired Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble; \u201cand although I was not snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour prerogative!\u201d sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said the word, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThe prerogative of a man is to command.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?\u201d cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo obey, ma\u2019am,\u201d thundered Mr. Bumble. \u201cYour late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now. I wish he was, poor man!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.\r\n\r\nBut, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble\u2019s soul; his heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cSo cry away.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.\r\n\r\nNow, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering.\r\n\r\nThe first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room. This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other. This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up!\u201d said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. \u201cAnd take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what something desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going?\u201d demanded Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to\u2014I\u2019m going, my dear! You are so very violent, that really I\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle. Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. He had a decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward. This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities. The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office.\r\n\r\nBut, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cHem!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. \u201cThese women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo there! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know I was here!\u201d repeated Mrs. Bumble. \u201cWhat do you do here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master\u2019s humility.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou thought they were talking too much?\u201d said Mrs. Bumble. \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, my dear\u2014\u201d urged Mr. Bumble submissively.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very true, you\u2019re matron here, my dear,\u201d submitted Mr. Bumble; \u201cbut I thought you mightn\u2019t be in the way just then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,\u201d returned his lady. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of your interference. You\u2019re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don\u2019t concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day. Be off; come!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person.\r\n\r\nWhat could Mr. Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight. It wanted but this. He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll in two months!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. \u201cTwo months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else\u2019s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street.\r\n\r\nHe walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty. He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer. It began to rain, heavily, at the moment. This determined him. Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street.\r\n\r\nThe man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak. He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance. He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him. Mr. Bumble\u2019s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger\u2019s eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.\r\n\r\nWhen they had encountered each other\u2019s glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you looking for me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you peered in at the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that I am aware of, unless you\u2019re Mr.\u2014\u201d Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger\u2019s name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see you were not,\u201d said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth; \u201cor you have known my name. You don\u2019t know it. I would recommend you not to ask for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI meant no harm, young man,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd have done none,\u201d said the stranger.\r\n\r\nAnother silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the stranger.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen you before, I think?\u201d said he. \u201cYou were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again. You were beadle here, once; were you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; \u201cporochial beadle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust so,\u201d rejoined the other, nodding his head. \u201cIt was in that character I saw you. What are you now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaster of the workhouse,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume. \u201cMaster of the workhouse, young man!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?\u201d resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble\u2019s eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, a married man,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, \u201cis not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one. Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cFill this glass again,\u201d he said, handing Mr. Bumble\u2019s empty tumbler to the landlord. \u201cLet it be strong and hot. You like it so, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot too strong,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand what that means, landlord!\u201d said the stranger, drily.\r\n\r\nThe host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the stranger, after closing the door and window. \u201cI came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind. I want some information from you. I don\u2019t ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is. Put up that, to begin with.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without. When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cCarry your memory back\u2014let me see\u2014twelve years, last winter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long time,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cVery good. I\u2019ve done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe scene, the workhouse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the time, night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves\u2014gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot \u2019em in the grave!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lying-in room, I suppose?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the stranger\u2019s excited description.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the stranger. \u201cA boy was born there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA many boys,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA murrain on the young devils!\u201d cried the stranger; \u201cI speak of one; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin-maker\u2014I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in it\u2014and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!\u201d said Mr. Bumble; \u201cI remember him, of course. There wasn\u2019t a obstinater young rascal\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not of him I want to hear; I\u2019ve heard enough of him,\u201d said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver\u2019s vices. \u201cIt\u2019s of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother. Where is she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious. \u201cIt would be hard to tell. There\u2019s no midwifery there, whichever place she\u2019s gone to; so I suppose she\u2019s out of employment, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d demanded the stranger, sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat she died last winter,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\nThe man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought. For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter. With that he rose, as if to depart.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half. He well remembered the night of old Sally\u2019s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman\u2019s attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist. Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can I find her?\u201d said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly through me,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d cried the stranger, hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow,\u201d rejoined Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt nine in the evening,\u201d said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in characters that betrayed his agitation; \u201cat nine in the evening, bring her to me there. I needn\u2019t tell you to be secret. It\u2019s your interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.\r\n\r\nOn glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble touched him on the arm. \u201cFollowing me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly to ask a question,\u201d said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper. \u201cWhat name am I to ask for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonks!\u201d rejoined the man; and strode hastily away.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nCONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nIt was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.\r\n\r\nThey were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though\u2014the way being dirty\u2014to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.\r\n\r\nThis was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime. It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river\u2019s bank. A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had long since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.\r\n\r\nIt was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe place should be somewhere here,\u201d said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalloa there!\u201d cried a voice from above.\r\n\r\nFollowing the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.\r\n\r\n\u201cStand still, a minute,\u201d cried the voice; \u201cI\u2019ll be with you directly.\u201d With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that the man?\u201d asked Mr. Bumble\u2019s good lady.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, mind what I told you,\u201d said the matron: \u201cand be careful to say as little as you can, or you\u2019ll betray us at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me here!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?\u201d said Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2014we were only cooling ourselves,\u201d stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cCooling yourselves!\u201d retorted Monks. \u201cNot all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell\u2019s fire out, as a man can carry about with him. You won\u2019t cool yourself so easily; don\u2019t think it!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the woman, is it?\u201d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cHem! That is the woman,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife\u2019s caution.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?\u201d said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know they will always keep one till it\u2019s found out,\u201d said Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what may that be?\u201d asked the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe loss of their own good name,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cSo, by the same rule, if a woman\u2019s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I\u2019m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you understand, mistress?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d said Monks. \u201cHow should you?\u201d\r\n\r\nBestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre.\r\n\r\n\u201cHear it!\u201d he cried, shrinking back. \u201cHear it! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it. I hate the sound!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese fits come over me, now and then,\u201d said Monks, observing his alarm; \u201cand thunder sometimes brings them on. Don\u2019t mind me now; it\u2019s all over for this once.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, \u201cthe sooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know what it is, does she?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout the mother of the boy you named,\u201d replied the matron interrupting him. \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first question is, of what nature was her communication?\u201d said Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second,\u201d observed the woman with much deliberation. \u201cThe first is, what may the communication be worth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody better than you, I am persuaded,\u201d answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.\r\n\r\n\u201cHumph!\u201d said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; \u201cthere may be money\u2019s worth to get, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps there may,\u201d was the composed reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething that was taken from her,\u201d said Monks. \u201cSomething that she wore. Something that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had better bid,\u201d interrupted Mrs. Bumble. \u201cI have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you?\u201d asked the woman, as collectedly as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cSpeak out, and let me know which.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdd five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,\u201d said the woman; \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you all I know. Not before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFive-and-twenty pounds!\u201d exclaimed Monks, drawing back.\r\n\r\n\u201cI spoke as plainly as I could,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble. \u201cIt\u2019s not a large sum, either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it\u2019s told!\u201d cried Monks impatiently; \u201cand which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,\u201d answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed. \u201cAs to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if I pay it for nothing?\u201d asked Monks, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can easily take it away again,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cI am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,\u201d submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: \u201cI am here, my dear. And besides,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, \u201cMr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; but he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I\u2019m once roused. I only want a little rousing; that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he did want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; \u201cand had better hold your tongue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can\u2019t speak in a lower tone,\u201d said Monks, grimly. \u201cSo! He\u2019s your husband, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe my husband!\u201d tittered the matron, parrying the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought as much, when you came in,\u201d rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. \u201cSo much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there\u2019s only one will between them. I\u2019m in earnest. See here!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cgather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let\u2019s hear your story.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen this woman, that we called old Sally, died,\u201d the matron began, \u201cshe and I were alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there no one by?\u201d asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; \u201cNo sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a soul,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cwe were alone. I stood alone beside the body when death came over it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Monks, regarding her attentively. \u201cGo on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe spoke of a young creature,\u201d resumed the matron, \u201cwho had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy?\u201d said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, \u201cBlood! How things come about!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe child was the one you named to him last night,\u201d said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; \u201cthe mother this nurse had robbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn life?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn death,\u201d replied the woman, with something like a shudder. \u201cShe stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant\u2019s sake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe sold it,\u201d cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; \u201cdid she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,\u201d said the matron, \u201cshe fell back and died.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout saying more?\u201d cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie! I\u2019ll not be played with. She said more. I\u2019ll tear the life out of you both, but I\u2019ll know what it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t utter another word,\u201d said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man\u2019s violence; \u201cbut she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich contained\u2014\u201d interposed Monks, stretching forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cit was a pawnbroker\u2019s duplicate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d demanded Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn good time I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d said the woman. \u201cI judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker\u2019s interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it now?\u201d asked Monks quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands. It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has the word \u2018Agnes\u2019 engraved on the inside,\u201d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this is all?\u201d said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll,\u201d replied the woman.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,\u201d said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; \u201cand I want to know nothing; for it\u2019s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may ask,\u201d said Monks, with some show of surprise; \u201cbut whether I answer or not is another question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014Which makes three,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that what you expected to get from me?\u201d demanded the matron.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cThe other question?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d rejoined Monks; \u201cnor against me either. See here! But don\u2019t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble\u2019s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook down,\u201d said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. \u201cDon\u2019t fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you flung a man\u2019s body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?\u201d said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,\u201d replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought.\r\n\r\nMonks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.\r\n\r\nThe three looking into each other\u2019s faces, seemed to breathe more freely.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position. \u201cIf the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?\u201d said Monks, with a threatening look. \u201cI am not afraid of your wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may depend upon me, young man,\u201d answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. \u201cOn everybody\u2019s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad, for your sake, to hear it,\u201d remarked Monks. \u201cLight your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.\r\n\r\nThey traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.\r\n\r\nThey were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nINTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER\r\n\r\nOn the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.\r\n\r\nThe room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane. Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman\u2019s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week\u2019s growth. The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention. Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber\u2019s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes\u2019s question.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot long gone seven,\u201d said the girl. \u201cHow do you feel to-night, Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs weak as water,\u201d replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs. \u201cHere; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\nIllness had not improved Mr. Sikes\u2019s temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhining are you?\u201d said Sikes. \u201cCome! Don\u2019t stand snivelling there. If you can\u2019t do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh. \u201cWhat fancy have you got in your head now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you\u2019ve thought better of it, have you?\u201d growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye. \u201cAll the better for you, you have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say, you\u2019d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,\u201d said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried Mr. Sikes. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch a number of nights,\u201d said the girl, with a touch of woman\u2019s tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice: \u201csuch a number of nights as I\u2019ve been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I\u2019ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn\u2019t have served me as you did just now, if you\u2019d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d rejoined Mr. Sikes, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Why, damme, now, the girls\u2019s whining again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. \u201cDon\u2019t you seem to mind me. It\u2019ll soon be over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll be over?\u201d demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. \u201cWhat foolery are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don\u2019t come over me with your woman\u2019s nonsense.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats. Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy\u2019s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here, my dear?\u201d said Fagin, looking in.\r\n\r\n\u201cLend a hand to the girl, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t stand chattering and grinning at me!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl\u2019s assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient\u2019s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGive her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,\u201d said Mr. Dawkins; \u201cand you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what evil wind has blowed you here?\u201d he asked Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I\u2019ve brought something good with me, that you\u2019ll be glad to see. Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn compliance with Mr. Fagin\u2019s request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence.\r\n\r\n\u201cSitch a rabbit pie, Bill,\u201d exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; \u201csitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there\u2019s no occasion to pick \u2019em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it\u2019ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn\u2019t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,\u2014oh no! Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo\u2019ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!\u201d\r\n\r\nUttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, Bill; you\u2019ll do now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Sikes; \u201cI might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you\u2019d have done anything to help me. What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly hear him, boys!\u201d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cAnd us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe things is well enough in their way,\u201d observed Mr. Sikes: a little soothed as he glanced over the table; \u201cbut what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that \u2019ere dog.\u2014Drive him down, Charley!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never see such a jolly dog as that,\u201d cried Master Bates, doing as he was desired. \u201cSmelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He\u2019d make his fortun\u2019 on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your din,\u201d cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily. \u201cWhat have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what about the other fortnight?\u201d demanded Sikes. \u201cWhat about the other fortnight that you\u2019ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, Bill. I can\u2019t go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn\u2019t help it, upon my honour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon your what?\u201d growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. \u201cHere! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it\u2019ll choke me dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be out of temper, my dear,\u201d urged Fagin, submissively. \u201cI have never forgot you, Bill; never once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ll pound it that you han\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes, with a bitter grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn\u2019t been for the girl, I might have died.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere now, Bill,\u201d remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says true enough there!\u201d said Nancy, coming hastily forward. \u201cLet him be; let him be.\u201d\r\n\r\nNancy\u2019s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d said Mr. Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some blunt from you to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t a piece of coin about me,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got lots at home,\u201d retorted Sikes; \u201cand I must have some from there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLots!\u201d cried Fagin, holding up is hands. \u201cI haven\u2019t so much as would\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some to-night; and that\u2019s flat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Fagin, with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019ll send the Artful round presently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t do nothing of the kind,\u201d rejoined Mr. Sikes. \u201cThe Artful\u2019s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I\u2019ll lie down and have a snooze while she\u2019s gone.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn\u2019t get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady\u2019s return.\r\n\r\nIn due course, they arrived at Fagin\u2019s abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends. Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas nobody been, Toby?\u201d asked Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a living leg,\u201d answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; \u201cit\u2019s been as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I\u2019m as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn\u2019t had the good natur\u2019 to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull, I\u2019m blessed if I an\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn\u2019t value his losses the snap of his little finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWot a rum chap you are, Tom!\u201d said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling. \u201cAm I, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA very clever fellow, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an\u2019t he, Fagin?\u201d asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt at all of that, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d pursued Tom.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so, indeed, my dear. They\u2019re only jealous, Tom, because he won\u2019t give it to them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Tom, triumphantly, \u201cthat\u2019s where it is! He has cleaned me out. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don\u2019t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It\u2019s time you were on the lay. Come! It\u2019s near ten, and nothing done yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Fagin, when they had left the room, \u201cI\u2019ll go and get you that cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money, for I\u2019ve got none to lock up, my dear\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u2014none to lock up. It\u2019s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I\u2019m fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!\u201d he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; \u201cwho\u2019s that? Listen!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man\u2019s voice reached her ears. The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time.\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; \u201cit\u2019s the man I expected before; he\u2019s coming downstairs. Not a word about the money while he\u2019s here, Nance. He won\u2019t stop long. Not ten minutes, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man\u2019s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.\r\n\r\nIt was Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one of my young people,\u201d said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger. \u201cDon\u2019t move, Nancy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny news?\u201d inquired Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd\u2014and\u2014good?\u201d asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot bad, any way,\u201d replied Monks with a smile. \u201cI have been prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that infernal hole we were in before,\u201d she could hear the man say as they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story.\r\n\r\nBefore the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest. The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above.\r\n\r\nThe room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Nance!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, \u201chow pale you are!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPale!\u201d echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don\u2019t know how long and all,\u201d replied the girl carelessly. \u201cCome! Let me get back; that\u2019s a dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand. They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a \u201cgood-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way. Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run. After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\nIt might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker.\r\n\r\nIf she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment. That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.\r\n\r\nAs that day closed in, the girl\u2019s excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, burn my body!\u201d said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face. \u201cYou look like a corpse come to life again. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMatter!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cNothing. What do you look at me so hard for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat foolery is this?\u201d demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly. \u201cWhat is it? What do you mean? What are you thinking of?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf many things, Bill,\u201d replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes. \u201cBut, Lord! What odds in that?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you wot it is,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cif you haven\u2019t caught the fever, and got it comin\u2019 on, now, there\u2019s something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too. You\u2019re not a-going to\u2014. No, damme! you wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere ain\u2019t,\u201d said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; \u201cthere ain\u2019t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I\u2019d have cut her throat three months ago. She\u2019s got the fever coming on; that\u2019s it.\u201d\r\n\r\nFortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the robber, \u201ccome and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I\u2019ll alter it so, that you won\u2019t know it agin when you do want it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened. He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe laudanum has taken effect at last,\u201d murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside. \u201cI may be too late, even now.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes\u2019s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber\u2019s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house.\r\n\r\nA watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas it long gone the half-hour?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll strike the hour in another quarter,\u201d said the man: raising his lantern to her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,\u201d muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.\r\n\r\nMany of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West-End of London. The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience. She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses\u2019 heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe woman is mad!\u201d said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall. The porter\u2019s seat was vacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, young woman!\u201d said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door behind her, \u201cwho do you want here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA lady who is stopping in this house,\u201d answered the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lady!\u201d was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. \u201cWhat lady?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Maylie,\u201d said Nancy.\r\n\r\nThe young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him, Nancy repeated her request.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat name am I to say?\u201d asked the waiter.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s of no use saying any,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor business?\u201d said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, nor that neither,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cI must see the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d said the man, pushing her towards the door. \u201cNone of this. Take yourself off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be carried out if I go!\u201d said the girl violently; \u201cand I can make that a job that two of you won\u2019t like to do. Isn\u2019t there anybody here,\u201d she said, looking round, \u201cthat will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake it up for her, Joe; can\u2019t you?\u201d said this person.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good?\u201d replied the man. \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis allusion to Nancy\u2019s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo what you like with me,\u201d said the girl, turning to the men again; \u201cbut do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty\u2019s sake.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to be?\u201d said the man, with one foot on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,\u201d said Nancy; \u201cand that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d said the man, \u201cyou\u2019re coming it strong!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou give the message,\u201d said the girl firmly; \u201cand let me hear the answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good being proper in this world,\u201d said the first housemaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,\u201d said the second.\r\n\r\nThe third contented herself with wondering \u201cwhat ladies was made of\u201d; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of \u201cShameful!\u201d with which the Dianas concluded.\r\n\r\nRegardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nA STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER\r\n\r\nThe girl\u2019s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman\u2019s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview.\r\n\r\nBut struggling with these better feelings was pride,\u2014the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured. The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,\u2014even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you\u2019d have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cDo not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the person you inquired for.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, lady, lady!\u201d she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face, \u201cif there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,\u2014there would\u2014there would!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said Rose, earnestly. \u201cIf you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,\u2014I shall indeed. Sit down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me stand, lady,\u201d said the girl, still weeping, \u201cand do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late. Is\u2014is\u2014that door shut?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it. \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin\u2019s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Rose Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI, lady!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat dreadful things are these!\u201d said Rose, involuntarily falling from her strange companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,\u201d cried the girl, \u201cthat you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and\u2014and\u2014something worse than all\u2014as I have been from my cradle. I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pity you!\u201d said Rose, in a broken voice. \u201cIt wrings my heart to hear you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeaven bless you for your goodness!\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cIf you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows you,\u201d replied the girl; \u201cand knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never heard the name,\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he goes by some other amongst us,\u201d rejoined the girl, \u201cwhich I more than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I\u2014suspecting this man\u2014listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark. I found out, from what I heard, that Monks\u2014the man I asked you about, you know\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, \u201cI understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014That Monks,\u201d pursued the girl, \u201chad seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn\u2019t make out why. A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,\u201d said the girl; \u201cand there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what occurred then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door. The first words I heard Monks say were these: \u2018So the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.\u2019 They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the young devil\u2019s money safely now, he\u2019d rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father\u2019s will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is all this!\u201d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cThen, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy\u2019s life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn\u2019t, he\u2019d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. \u2018In short, Fagin,\u2019 he says, \u2018Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I\u2019ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis brother!\u201d exclaimed Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose were his words,\u201d said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually. \u201cAnd more. When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged spaniel was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not mean,\u201d said Rose, turning very pale, \u201cto tell me that this was said in earnest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head. \u201cHe is an earnest man when his hatred is up. I know many who do worse things; but I\u2019d rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once. It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. I must get back quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what can I do?\u201d said Rose. \u201cTo what use can I turn this communication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour\u2019s delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish to go back,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI must go back, because\u2014how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?\u2014because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can\u2019t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour having interfered in this dear boy\u2019s behalf before,\u201d said Rose; \u201cyour coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed. Oh!\u201d said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face, \u201cdo not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first\u2014the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion. Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady,\u201d cried the girl, sinking on her knees, \u201cdear, sweet, angel lady, you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is never too late,\u201d said Rose, \u201cfor penitence and atonement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; \u201cI cannot leave him now! I could not be his death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should you be?\u201d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing could save him,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cIf I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible,\u201d cried Rose, \u201cthat for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is madness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d answered the girl; \u201cI only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself. I must go back. Whether it is God\u2019s wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d said Rose. \u201cI should not let you depart from me thus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should, lady, and I know you will,\u201d rejoined the girl, rising. \u201cYou will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what use, then, is the communication you have made?\u201d said Rose. \u201cThis mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,\u201d rejoined the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut where can I find you again when it is necessary?\u201d asked Rose. \u201cI do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise you solemnly,\u201d answered Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,\u201d said the girl without hesitation, \u201cI will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay another moment,\u201d interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door. \u201cThink once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it. You have a claim on me: not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you? What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch! Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,\u201d replied the girl steadily, \u201cgive away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths\u2014even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us? Pity us, lady\u2014pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will,\u201d said Rose, after a pause, \u201ctake some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty\u2014at all events until we meet again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a penny,\u201d replied the girl, waving her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,\u201d said Rose, stepping gently forward. \u201cI wish to serve you indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would serve me best, lady,\u201d replied the girl, wringing her hands, \u201cif you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived. God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nCONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE\r\n\r\nHer situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver\u2019s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie\u2019s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.\r\n\r\nThey purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion?\r\n\r\nMr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman\u2019s impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver\u2019s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl\u2019s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person. These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when\u2014the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection\u2014he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.\r\n\r\nDisturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it be painful to him,\u201d she thought, \u201cto come back here, how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me\u2014he did when he went away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.\u201d And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.\r\n\r\nShe had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you look so flurried?\u201d asked Rose, advancing to meet him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,\u201d replied the boy. \u201cOh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never thought you had told us anything but the truth,\u201d said Rose, soothing him. \u201cBut what is this?\u2014of whom do you speak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the gentleman,\u201d replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, \u201cthe gentleman who was so good to me\u2014Mr. Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d asked Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cGetting out of a coach,\u201d replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, \u201cand going into a house. I didn\u2019t speak to him\u2014I couldn\u2019t speak to him, for he didn\u2019t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did. Look here,\u201d said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, \u201chere it is; here\u2019s where he lives\u2014I\u2019m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me! What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick!\u201d she said. \u201cTell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute\u2019s loss of time. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\nOliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, \u201cI beg your pardon, young lady\u2014I imagined it was some importunate person who\u2014I beg you will excuse me. Be seated, pray.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?\u201d said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is my name,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThis is my friend, Mr. Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe,\u201d interposed Miss Maylie, \u201cthat at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,\u201d said Rose, naturally embarrassed; \u201cbut you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver Twist you knew him as,\u201d replied Rose.\r\n\r\nThe words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.\r\n\r\nMr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie\u2019s, and said,\r\n\r\n\u201cDo me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven\u2019s name put me in possession of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA bad one! I\u2019ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,\u201d said Rose, colouring; \u201cand that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m only sixty-one,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. \u201cAnd, as the devil\u2019s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don\u2019t see the application of that remark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201che does not mean what he says.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he does,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he does not,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll eat his head, if he doesn\u2019t,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he\u2019d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,\u201d responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.\r\n\r\nHaving gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cto return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow\u2019s house; reserving Nancy\u2019s information for that gentleman\u2019s private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God!\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThis is great happiness to me, great happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie. You must pardon my finding fault with you,\u2014but why not have brought him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is waiting in a coach at the door,\u201d replied Rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt this door!\u201d cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word.\r\n\r\nWhen the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m old enough to be your grandfather. You\u2019re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver\u2019s behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. \u201cSend Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, rather testily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that I do, sir,\u201d replied the old lady. \u201cPeople\u2019s eyes, at my time of life, don\u2019t improve with age, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could have told you that,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \u201cbut put on your glasses, and see if you can\u2019t find out what you were wanted for, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But Oliver\u2019s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod be good to me!\u201d cried the old lady, embracing him; \u201cit is my innocent boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear old nurse!\u201d cried Oliver.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe would come back\u2014I knew he would,\u201d said the old lady, holding him in her arms. \u201cHow well he looks, and how like a gentleman\u2019s son he is dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.\u201d Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.\r\n\r\nLeaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o\u2019clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.\r\n\r\nRose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor\u2019s wrath. Nancy\u2019s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment\u2019s consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what the devil is to be done?\u201d said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies. \u201cAre we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly that,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; \u201cbut we must proceed gently and with great care.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGentleness and care,\u201d exclaimed the doctor. \u201cI\u2019d send them one and all to\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind where,\u201d interposed Mr. Brownlow. \u201cBut reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat object?\u201d asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cSimply, the discovery of Oliver\u2019s parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief; \u201cI almost forgot that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Mr. Brownlow; \u201cplacing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHanging a few of them at least, in all probability,\u201d suggested the doctor, \u201cand transporting the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; \u201cbut no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest\u2014or at least to Oliver\u2019s, which is the same thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d inquired the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him. He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d said the doctor impetuously, \u201cI put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. \u201cThe promise shall be kept. I don\u2019t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman\u2019s proposition was carried unanimously.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like,\u201d he said, \u201cto call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,\u201d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must put it to the vote,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cwho may he be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat lady\u2019s son, and this young lady\u2019s\u2014very old friend,\u201d said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece.\r\n\r\nRose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe stay in town, of course,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cwhile there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success. I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow. \u201cAnd as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver\u2019s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted her into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER\u2019S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\nUpon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention.\r\n\r\nThey were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female: for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,\u2014looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys. The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back. Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough. This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion.\r\n\r\nThus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion,\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on, can\u2019t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heavy load, I can tell you,\u201d said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue.\r\n\r\n\u201cHeavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?\u201d rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other shoulder. \u201cOh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain\u2019t enough to tire anybody\u2019s patience out, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it much farther?\u201d asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch farther! Yer as good as there,\u201d said the long-legged tramper, pointing out before him. \u201cLook there! Those are the lights of London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re a good two mile off, at least,\u201d said the woman despondingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind whether they\u2019re two mile off, or twenty,\u201d said Noah Claypole; for he it was; \u201cbut get up and come on, or I\u2019ll kick yer, and so I give yer notice.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Noah\u2019s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?\u201d she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow should I know?\u201d replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking.\r\n\r\n\u201cNear, I hope,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not near,\u201d replied Mr. Claypole. \u201cThere! Not near; so don\u2019t think it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I tell yer that I don\u2019t mean to do a thing, that\u2019s enough, without any why or because either,\u201d replied Mr. Claypole with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you needn\u2019t be so cross,\u201d said his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pretty thing it would be, wouldn\u2019t it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,\u201d said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. \u201cNo! I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on. Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I\u2019ve got a head; for if we hadn\u2019t gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer\u2019d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady. And serve yer right for being a fool.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know I ain\u2019t as cunning as you are,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut don\u2019t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You would have been if I had been, any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,\u201d said Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took it for you, Noah, dear,\u201d rejoined Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I keep it?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,\u201d said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through his.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole\u2019s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape. Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest. Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John\u2019s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray\u2019s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London.\r\n\r\nThrough these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose. At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo give us the bundle,\u201d said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman\u2019s shoulders, and slinging it over his own; \u201cand don\u2019t yer speak, except when yer spoke to. What\u2019s the name of the house\u2014t-h-r\u2014three what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCripples,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cThree Cripples,\u201d repeated Noah, \u201cand a very good sign too. Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along.\u201d With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him.\r\n\r\nIf Noah had been attired in his charity-boy\u2019s dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this the Three Cripples?\u201d asked Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the dabe of this \u2019ouse,\u201d replied the Jew.\r\n\r\n\u201cA gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,\u201d said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise. \u201cWe want to sleep here to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019b dot certaid you cad,\u201d said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; \u201cbut I\u2019ll idquire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShow us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?\u201d said Noah.\r\n\r\nBarney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment.\r\n\r\nNow, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation. The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening\u2019s business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d said Barney: \u201cstradegers id the next roob.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStrangers!\u201d repeated the old man in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Ad rub uds too,\u201d added Barney. \u201cFrob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I\u2019b bistaked.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.\r\n\r\nMounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d he whispered, looking round to Barney, \u201cI like that fellow\u2019s looks. He\u2019d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already. Don\u2019t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear \u2019em talk\u2014let me hear \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I mean to be a gentleman,\u201d said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear. \u201cNo more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman\u2019s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like that well enough, dear,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut tills ain\u2019t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTills be blowed!\u201d said Mr. Claypole; \u201cthere\u2019s more things besides tills to be emptied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cPockets, women\u2019s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!\u201d said Mr. Claypole, rising with the porter.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t do all that, dear,\u201d said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall look out to get into company with them as can,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!\u201d exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, that\u2019ll do: don\u2019t yer be too affectionate, in case I\u2019m cross with yer,\u201d said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. \u201cI should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of \u2019em, and follering \u2019em about, unbeknown to themselves. That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you\u2019ve got,\u2014especially as we don\u2019t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed. He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was Mr. Fagin. And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands. \u201cFrom the country, I see, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do yer see that?\u201d asked Noah Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have not so much dust as that in London,\u201d replied Fagin, pointing from Noah\u2019s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYer a sharp feller,\u201d said Noah. \u201cHa! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; \u201cand that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger,\u2014a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose. However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood stuff that,\u201d observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear!\u201d said Fagin. \u201cA man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman\u2019s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. \u201cHa! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very lucky it was only me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take it,\u201d stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair; \u201cit was all her doing; yer\u2019ve got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo matter who\u2019s got it, or who did it, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk\u2019s eye at the girl and the two bundles. \u201cI\u2019m in that way myself, and I like you for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that way of business,\u201d rejoined Fagin; \u201cand so are the people of the house. You\u2019ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be. There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I\u2019ve said the word, and you may make your minds easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole\u2019s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you more,\u201d said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. \u201cI have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYer speak as if yer were in earnest,\u201d replied Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat advantage would it be to me to be anything else?\u201d inquired Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cHere! Let me have a word with you outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,\u201d said Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. \u201cShe\u2019ll take the luggage upstairs the while. Charlotte, see to them bundles.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s kept tolerably well under, ain\u2019t she?\u201d he asked as he resumed his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite perfect,\u201d rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I suppose if I wasn\u2019t, I shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cBut, I say, she\u2019ll be back if yer lose time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what do you think?\u201d said Fagin. \u201cIf you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he in a good way of business; that\u2019s where it is!\u201d responded Noah, winking one of his little eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRegular town-maders?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a countryman among \u2019em; and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take you, even on my recommendation, if he didn\u2019t run rather short of assistants just now,\u201d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cShould I have to hand over?\u201d said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be done without,\u201d replied Fagin, in a most decided manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty pound, though\u2014it\u2019s a lot of money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot when it\u2019s in a note you can\u2019t get rid of,\u201d retorted Fagin. \u201cNumber and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It\u2019s not worth much to him. It\u2019ll have to go abroad, and he couldn\u2019t sell it for a great deal in the market.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen could I see him?\u201d asked Noah doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUm!\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhat\u2019s the wages?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLive like a gentleman\u2014board and lodging, pipes and spirits free\u2014half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,\u201d replied Mr. Fagin.\r\n\r\nWhether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, yer see,\u201d observed Noah, \u201cas she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little fancy work?\u201d suggested Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! something of that sort,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhat do you think would suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know. That\u2019s the sort of thing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cMy friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, I did mention that, and I shouldn\u2019t mind turning my hand to it sometimes,\u201d rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t pay by itself, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate. \u201cNo, it might not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, then?\u201d asked Noah, anxiously regarding him. \u201cSomething in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of the old ladies?\u201d asked Fagin. \u201cThere\u2019s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?\u201d asked Noah, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would answer my purpose. Ain\u2019t there any other line open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s knee. \u201cThe kinchin lay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d demanded Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe kinchins, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cis the young children that\u2019s sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away\u2014they\u2019ve always got it ready in their hands,\u2014then knock \u2019em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy. \u201cLord, that\u2019s the very thing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure it is,\u201d replied Fagin; \u201cand you can have a few good beats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like that, where they\u2019re always going errands; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right!\u201d said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and Charlotte had returned. \u201cWhat time to-morrow shall we say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill ten do?\u201d asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent, \u201cWhat name shall I tell my good friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Bolter,\u201d replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency. \u201cMr. Morris Bolter. This is Mrs. Bolter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Bolter\u2019s humble servant,\u201d said Fagin, bowing with grotesque politeness. \u201cI hope I shall know her better very shortly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?\u201d thundered Mr. Claypole.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Noah, dear!\u201d replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,\u201d said Mr. Morris Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. \u201cYou understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, I understand\u2014perfectly,\u201d replied Fagin, telling the truth for once. \u201cGood-night! Good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah Claypole, bespeaking his good lady\u2019s attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nWHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so it was you that was your own friend, was it?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into between them, he had removed next day to Fagin\u2019s house. \u201cCod, I thought as much last night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery man\u2019s his own friend, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, with his most insinuating grin. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t as good a one as himself anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept sometimes,\u201d replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of the world. \u201cSome people are nobody\u2019s enemies but their own, yer know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe that,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cWhen a man\u2019s his own enemy, it\u2019s only because he\u2019s too much his own friend; not because he\u2019s careful for everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain\u2019t such a thing in nature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere oughn\u2019t to be, if there is,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat stands to reason. Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number, and some say number seven. It\u2019s neither, my friend, neither. It\u2019s number one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Mr. Bolter. \u201cNumber one for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a little community like ours, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, who felt it necessary to qualify this position, \u201cwe have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the devil!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, \u201cwe are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so. For instance, it\u2019s your object to take care of number one\u2014meaning yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter. \u201cYer about right there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell! You can\u2019t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNumber two, you mean,\u201d said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d retorted Fagin. \u201cI\u2019m of the same importance to you, as you are to yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d interrupted Mr. Bolter, \u201cyer a very nice man, and I\u2019m very fond of yer; but we ain\u2019t quite so thick together, as all that comes to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly think,\u201d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out his hands; \u201conly consider. You\u2019ve done what\u2019s a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that\u2019s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose\u2014in plain English, the halter!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gallows,\u201d continued Fagin, \u201cthe gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow\u2019s career on the broad highway. To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter. \u201cWhat do yer talk about such things for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly to show you my meaning clearly,\u201d said the Jew, raising his eyebrows. \u201cTo be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the second my number one. The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first\u2014that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. \u201cOh! yer a cunning old codger!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter\u2019s respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cMy best hand was taken from me, yesterday morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say he died?\u201d cried Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cnot so bad as that. Not quite so bad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, I suppose he was\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWanted,\u201d interposed Fagin. \u201cYes, he was wanted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery particular?\u201d inquired Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cnot very. He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,\u2014his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I\u2019d give the price of as many to have him back. You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but I shall know him, I hope; don\u2019t yer think so?\u201d said Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doubtful about it,\u201d replied Fagin, with a sigh. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get any fresh evidence, it\u2019ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it\u2019s a case of lagging. They know what a clever lad he is; he\u2019ll be a lifer. They\u2019ll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by lagging and a lifer?\u201d demanded Mr. Bolter. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of talking in that way to me; why don\u2019t yer speak so as I can understand yer?\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words, \u201ctransportation for life,\u201d when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all up, Fagin,\u201d said Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more\u2019s a coming to \u2019dentify him; and the Artful\u2019s booked for a passage out,\u201d replied Master Bates. \u201cI must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. To think of Jack Dawkins\u2014lummy Jack\u2014the Dodger\u2014the Artful Dodger\u2014going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box! I never thought he\u2019d a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. Oh, why didn\u2019t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!\u201d exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. \u201cWasn\u2019t he always the top-sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent! Eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot one,\u201d replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret; \u201cnot one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what do you talk of?\u201d replied Fagin angrily; \u201cwhat are you blubbering for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Cause it isn\u2019t on the rec-ord, is it?\u201d said Charley, chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets; \u201c\u2019cause it can\u2019t come out in the \u2019dictment; \u2019cause nobody will never know half of what he was. How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar? P\u2019raps not be there at all. Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy; \u201csee what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. Ain\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, Charley,\u201d said Fagin soothingly; \u201cit\u2019ll come out, it\u2019ll be sure to come out. They\u2019ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he\u2019ll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. Think how young he is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is a honour that is!\u201d said Charley, a little consoled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe shall have all he wants,\u201d continued the Jew. \u201cHe shall be kept in the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can\u2019t spend it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, shall he though?\u201d cried Charley Bates.\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, that he shall,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand we\u2019ll have a big-wig, Charley: one that\u2019s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we\u2019ll read it all in the papers\u2014\u2018Artful Dodger\u2014shrieks of laughter\u2014here the court was convulsed\u2019\u2014eh, Charley, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d laughed Master Bates, \u201cwhat a lark that would be, wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother \u2019em wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cHe shall\u2014he will!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, to be sure, so he will,\u201d repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I see him now,\u201d cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d cried Charley Bates. \u201cHa! ha! ha! so do I. I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. What a game! What a regular game! All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of \u2019em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge\u2019s own son making a speech arter dinner\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend\u2019s eccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cLet me think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go?\u201d asked Charley.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for the world,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cAre you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you\u2019d walk into the very place where\u2014No, Charley, no. One is enough to lose at a time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to go yourself, I suppose?\u201d said Charley with a humorous leer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d replied Fagin shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you send this new cove?\u201d asked Master Bates, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s arm. \u201cNobody knows him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, if he didn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d observed Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cMind!\u201d interposed Charley. \u201cWhat should he have to mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally nothing, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, \u201creally nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I dare say about that, yer know,\u201d observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. \u201cNo, no\u2014none of that. It\u2019s not in my department, that ain\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot department has he got, Fagin?\u201d inquired Master Bates, surveying Noah\u2019s lank form with much disgust. \u201cThe cutting away when there\u2019s anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there\u2019s everything right; is that his branch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d retorted Mr. Bolter; \u201cand don\u2019t yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer\u2019ll find yerself in the wrong shop.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaster Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.\r\n\r\nPersuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin\u2019s directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner\u2019s frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter\u2019s whip. Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.\r\n\r\nNoah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which\u2014Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality\u2014were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way.\r\n\r\nHe found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice.\r\n\r\nThere were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table. A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman \u201cTake that baby out,\u201d when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother\u2019s shawl, from some meagre infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock\u2014the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.\r\n\r\nNoah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character\u2019s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that \u2019ere disgraceful sitivation for.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, will you?\u201d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an Englishman, ain\u2019t I?\u201d rejoined the Dodger. \u201cWhere are my priwileges?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get your privileges soon enough,\u201d retorted the jailer, \u201cand pepper with \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks, if I don\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Dawkins. \u201cNow then! Wot is this here business? I shall thank the madg\u2019strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I\u2019ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he\u2019ll go away if I ain\u2019t there to my time, and then pr\u2019aps ther won\u2019t be an action for damage against them as kep me away. Oh no, certainly not!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate \u201cthe names of them two files as was on the bench.\u201d Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request.\r\n\r\n\u201cSilence there!\u201d cried the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d inquired one of the magistrates.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pick-pocketing case, your worship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas the boy ever been here before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe ought to have been, a many times,\u201d replied the jailer. \u201cHe has been pretty well everywhere else. I know him well, your worship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you know me, do you?\u201d cried the Artful, making a note of the statement. \u201cWery good. That\u2019s a case of deformation of character, any way.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, where are the witnesses?\u201d said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that\u2019s right,\u201d added the Dodger. \u201cWhere are they? I should like to see \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance. For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner\u2019s name engraved upon the lid. This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to. He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anything to ask this witness, boy?\u201d said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,\u201d replied the Dodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anything to say at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear his worship ask if you\u2019ve anything to say?\u201d inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said the Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction. \u201cDid you redress yourself to me, my man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,\u201d observed the officer with a grin. \u201cDo you mean to say anything, you young shaver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the Dodger, \u201cnot here, for this ain\u2019t the shop for justice: besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and \u2019spectable circle of acquaintance as\u2019ll make them beaks wish they\u2019d never been born, or that they\u2019d got their footmen to hang \u2019em up to their own hat-pegs, afore they let \u2019em come out this morning to try it on upon me. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere! He\u2019s fully committed!\u201d interposed the clerk. \u201cTake him away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh ah! I\u2019ll come on,\u201d replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm of his hand. \u201cAh! (to the Bench) it\u2019s no use your looking frightened; I won\u2019t show you no mercy, not a ha\u2019porth of it. You\u2019ll pay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn\u2019t be you for something! I wouldn\u2019t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me. Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer\u2019s face, with great glee and self-approval.\r\n\r\nHaving seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person.\r\n\r\nThe two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nTHE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE FAILS.\r\n\r\nAdept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last\u2014richly as he merited such a fate\u2014by her hand.\r\n\r\nBut, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her\u2014and what more could she do! She was resolved.\r\n\r\nThough all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. She grew pale and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards\u2014she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour. Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn hour this side of midnight,\u201d said Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat. \u201cDark and heavy it is too. A good night for business this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cWhat a pity, Bill, my dear, that there\u2019s none quite ready to be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right for once,\u201d replied Sikes gruffly. \u201cIt is a pity, for I\u2019m in the humour too.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must make up for lost time when we\u2019ve got things into a good train. That\u2019s all I know,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way to talk, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, venturing to pat him on the shoulder. \u201cIt does me good to hear you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes you good, does it!\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cWell, so be it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this concession. \u201cYou\u2019re like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,\u201d said Sikes, casting off the Jew\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt make you nervous, Bill,\u2014reminds you of being nabbed, does it?\u201d said Fagin, determined not to be offended.\r\n\r\n\u201cReminds me of being nabbed by the devil,\u201d returned Sikes. \u201cThere never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old \u2019un without any father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn\u2019t wonder at, a bit.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cHallo!\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cNance. Where\u2019s the gal going to at this time of night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot far.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat answer\u2019s that?\u201d retorted Sikes. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where,\u201d replied the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I do,\u201d said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed. \u201cNowhere. Sit down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not well. I told you that before,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cI want a breath of air.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPut your head out of the winder,\u201d replied Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough there,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI want it in the street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t have it,\u201d replied Sikes. With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press. \u201cThere,\u201d said the robber. \u201cNow stop quietly where you are, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,\u201d said the girl turning very pale. \u201cWhat do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKnow what I\u2019m\u2014Oh!\u201d cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, \u201cshe\u2019s out of her senses, you know, or she daren\u2019t talk to me in that way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll drive me on the something desperate,\u201d muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak. \u201cLet me go, will you,\u2014this minute\u2014this instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It\u2019ll be better for him. Do you hear me?\u201d cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cHear you!\u201d repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her. \u201cAye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as\u2019ll tear some of that screaming voice out. Wot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me go,\u201d said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, \u201cBill, let me go; you don\u2019t know what you are doing. You don\u2019t, indeed. For only one hour\u2014do\u2014do!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCut my limbs off one by one!\u201d cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm, \u201cIf I don\u2019t think the gal\u2019s stark raving mad. Get up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot till you let me go\u2014not till you let me go\u2014Never\u2014never!\u201d screamed the girl. Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o\u2019clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further. With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhew!\u201d said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face. \u201cWot a precious strange gal that is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may say that, Bill,\u201d replied Fagin thoughtfully. \u201cYou may say that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?\u201d asked Sikes. \u201cCome; you should know her better than me. Wot does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cObstinacy; woman\u2019s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose it is,\u201d growled Sikes. \u201cI thought I had tamed her, but she\u2019s as bad as ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWorse,\u201d said Fagin thoughtfully. \u201cI never knew her like this, for such a little cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor I,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cI think she\u2019s got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won\u2019t come out\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she\u2019s took that way again,\u201d said Sikes.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cWe was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it\u2019s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a whisper. \u201cHush!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, now she\u2019s on the other tack!\u201d exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade him good-night. He paused when he reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cLight him down,\u201d said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers. Show him a light.\u201d\r\n\r\nNancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Nancy, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d replied the girl, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe reason of all this,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cIf he\u201d\u2014he pointed with his skinny fore-finger up the stairs\u2014\u201cis so hard with you (he\u2019s a brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo matter just now. We\u2019ll talk of this again. You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog\u2014like a dog! worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes\u2014come to me. I say, come to me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you well,\u201d replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion. \u201cGood-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.\r\n\r\nFagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain. He had conceived the idea\u2014not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees\u2014that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker\u2019s brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons. He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay.\r\n\r\nThere was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked\u2014to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life\u2014on the object of her more recent fancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith a little persuasion,\u201d thought Fagin, \u201cwhat more likely than that she would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now. There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker\u2019s room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at parting showed that.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. \u201cHow,\u201d thought Fagin, as he crept homeward, \u201ccan I increase my influence with her? What new power can I acquire?\u201d\r\n\r\nSuch brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance?\r\n\r\n\u201cI can,\u201d said Fagin, almost aloud. \u201cShe durst not refuse me then. Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nNOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION\r\n\r\nThe old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cBolter,\u201d said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, here I am,\u201d returned Noah. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating. That\u2019s a great fault in this place. Yer never get time enough over yer meals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can talk as you eat, can\u2019t you?\u201d said Fagin, cursing his dear young friend\u2019s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh yes, I can talk. I get on better when I talk,\u201d said Noah, cutting a monstrous slice of bread. \u201cWhere\u2019s Charlotte?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOut,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cI sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Noah. \u201cI wish yer\u2019d ordered her to make some buttered toast first. Well. Talk away. Yer won\u2019t interrupt me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did well yesterday, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cBeautiful! Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,\u201d said Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my dear. The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well, I think, for a beginner,\u201d remarked Mr. Bolter complacently. \u201cThe pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was standing by itself outside a public-house. I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you, Bolter,\u201d said Fagin, leaning over the table, \u201cto do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d rejoined Bolter, \u201cdon\u2019t yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o\u2019 yer police-offices. That don\u2019t suit me, that don\u2019t; and so I tell yer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the smallest danger in it\u2014not the very smallest,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cit\u2019s only to dodge a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn old woman?\u201d demanded Mr. Bolter.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young one,\u201d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can do that pretty well, I know,\u201d said Bolter. \u201cI was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school. What am I to dodge her for? Not to\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll yer give me?\u201d asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound,\u201d said Fagin, wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn\u2019t valuable consideration to be gained.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d inquired Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Lor!\u201d cried Noah, curling up his nose. \u201cYer doubtful of her, are yer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,\u201d replied Fagin.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Noah. \u201cJust to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they\u2019re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I\u2019m your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you would be,\u201d cried Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhere is she? Where am I to wait for her? Where am I to go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I\u2019ll point her out at the proper time,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cYou keep ready, and leave the rest to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter\u2019s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin. Six nights passed\u2014six long weary nights\u2014and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal. It was Sunday.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe goes abroad to-night,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cand on the right errand, I\u2019m sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak. Come with me. Quick!\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven o\u2019clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them.\r\n\r\nScarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that the woman?\u201d he asked, scarcely above his breath.\r\n\r\nFagin nodded yes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see her face well,\u201d whispered Noah. \u201cShe is looking down, and the candle is behind her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay there,\u201d whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew. In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see her now,\u201d cried the spy.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlainly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should know her among a thousand.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out. Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cHist!\u201d cried the lad who held the door. \u201cDow.\u201d\r\n\r\nNoah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the left,\u201d whispered the lad; \u201ctake the left had, and keep od the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl\u2019s retreating figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nTHE APPOINTMENT KEPT\r\n\r\nThe church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back. The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The man stopped too.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were, hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London\u2019s destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.\r\n\r\nA mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.\r\n\r\nThe girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro\u2014closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer\u2014when the heavy bell of St. Paul\u2019s tolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded city. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.\r\n\r\nThe hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.\r\n\r\nThey walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate. They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up\u2014brushed against them, indeed\u2014at that precise moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot here,\u201d said Nancy hurriedly, \u201cI am afraid to speak to you here. Come away\u2014out of the public road\u2014down the steps yonder!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.\r\n\r\nThe steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, form a landing-stairs from the river. To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment\u2019s survey of the place, he began to descend.\r\n\r\nThese stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.\r\n\r\nSo tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation. He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.\r\n\r\nHe drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is far enough,\u201d said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman. \u201cI will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo humour me!\u201d cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed. \u201cYou\u2019re considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well, it\u2019s no matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, for what,\u201d said the gentleman in a kinder tone, \u201cfor what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you before,\u201d replied Nancy, \u201cthat I was afraid to speak to you there. I don\u2019t know why it is,\u201d said the girl, shuddering, \u201cbut I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fear of what?\u201d asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI scarcely know of what,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI wish I did. Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImagination,\u201d said the gentleman, soothing her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo imagination,\u201d replied the girl in a hoarse voice. \u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw \u2018coffin\u2019 written in every page of the book in large black letters,\u2014aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing unusual in that,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cThey have passed me often.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReal ones,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cThis was not.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him. He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak to her kindly,\u201d said the young lady to her companion. \u201cPoor creature! She seems to need it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cOh, dear lady, why ar\u2019n\u2019t those who claim to be God\u2019s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cA Turk turns his face, after washing it well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven. Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!\u201d\r\n\r\nThese words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself. The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not here last Sunday night,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t come,\u201d replied Nancy; \u201cI was kept by force.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHim that I told the young lady of before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?\u201d asked the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn\u2019t give him a drink of laudanum before I came away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he awake before you returned?\u201d inquired the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cNow listen to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ready,\u201d replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis young lady,\u201d the gentleman began, \u201chas communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a fortnight since. I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d said the girl earnestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI repeat that I firmly believe it. To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. But if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d cried the girl, recoiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat man must be delivered up by you,\u201d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not do it! I will never do it!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cDevil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not?\u201d said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!\u201d returned the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor one reason,\u201d rejoined the girl firmly, \u201cfor one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I\u2019ll not turn upon them, who might\u2014any of them\u2014have turned upon me, but didn\u2019t, bad as they are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain; \u201cput Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if he turns against the others?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver\u2019s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if it is not?\u201d suggested the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d pursued the gentleman, \u201cthis Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent. In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave I the lady\u2019s promise for that?\u201d asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cMy true and faithful pledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonks would never learn how you knew what you do?\u201d said the girl, after a short pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d replied the gentleman. \u201cThe intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,\u201d said the girl after another interval of silence, \u201cbut I will take your words.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that night. From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated. When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is tall,\u201d said the girl, \u201cand a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don\u2019t forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man\u2019s, that you might almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can\u2019t be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds\u2014why did you start?\u201d said the girl, stopping suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed.\r\n\r\n\u201cPart of this,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak. I think that\u2019s all I can give you to know him by. Stay though,\u201d she added. \u201cUpon his throat: so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA broad red mark, like a burn or scald?\u201d cried the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d said the girl. \u201cYou know him!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I do,\u201d said the gentleman, breaking silence. \u201cI should by your description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other. It may not be the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, \u201cIt must be he!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where he had stood before, \u201cyou have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Nancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not persist in saying that,\u201d rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart. \u201cThink now. Tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, sir,\u201d rejoined the girl, weeping. \u201cYou can do nothing to help me. I am past all hope, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou put yourself beyond its pale,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cThe past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you. Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will be persuaded now,\u201d cried the young lady. \u201cShe hesitates, I am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not, my dear,\u201d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sir, I do not,\u201d replied the girl, after a short struggle. \u201cI am chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it. I must have gone too far to turn back,\u2014and yet I don\u2019t know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off. But,\u201d she said, looking hastily round, \u201cthis fear comes over me again. I must go home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHome!\u201d repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.\r\n\r\n\u201cHome, lady,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cTo such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life. Let us part. I shall be watched or seen. Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is useless,\u201d said the gentleman, with a sigh. \u201cWe compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here. We may have detained her longer than she expected already.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d urged the girl. \u201cYou have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat,\u201d cried the young lady, \u201ccan be the end of this poor creature\u2019s life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d repeated the girl. \u201cLook before you, lady. Look at that dark water. How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not speak thus, pray,\u201d returned the young lady, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors should!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cGood-night, good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman turned away.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis purse,\u201d cried the young lady. \u201cTake it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI have not done this for money. Let me have that to think of. And yet\u2014give me something that you have worn: I should like to have something\u2014no, no, not a ring\u2014your gloves or handkerchief\u2014anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good-night, good-night!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.\r\n\r\nThe sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.\r\n\r\nThe two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge. They stopped at the summit of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cHark!\u201d cried the young lady, listening. \u201cDid she call! I thought I heard her voice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my love,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. \u201cShe has not moved, and will not till we are gone.\u201d\r\n\r\nRose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away. As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended.\r\n\r\nPeeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the Jew\u2019s house as fast as his legs would carry him.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nFATAL CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.\r\n\r\nHe sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side. His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog\u2019s or rat\u2019s.\r\n\r\nStretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIndeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart.\r\n\r\nHe sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last,\u201d he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. \u201cAt last!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d he said, laying the bundle on the table. \u201cTake care of that, and do the most you can with it. It\u2019s been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.\r\n\r\n\u201cWot now?\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cWot do you look at a man so for?\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamme!\u201d said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. \u201cHe\u2019s gone mad. I must look to myself here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014you\u2019re not the person, Bill. I\u2019ve no\u2014no fault to find with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you haven\u2019t, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s lucky\u2014for one of us. Which one that is, don\u2019t matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got that to tell you, Bill,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair nearer, \u201cwill make you worse than me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAye?\u201d returned the robber with an incredulous air. \u201cTell away! Look sharp, or Nance will think I\u2019m lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLost!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cShe has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.\u201d\r\n\r\nSikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew\u2019s face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak, will you!\u201d he said; \u201cor if you don\u2019t, it shall be for want of breath. Open your mouth and say wot you\u2019ve got to say in plain words. Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose that lad that\u2019s laying there\u2014\u201d Fagin began.\r\n\r\nSikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously observed him. \u201cWell!\u201d he said, resuming his former position.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose that lad,\u201d pursued Fagin, \u201cwas to peach\u2014to blow upon us all\u2014first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with \u2019em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plant we\u2019ve all been in, more or less\u2014of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water,\u2014but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them. Do you hear me?\u201d cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage. \u201cSuppose he did all this, what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then!\u201d replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath. \u201cIf he was left alive till I came, I\u2019d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if I did it!\u201d cried Fagin almost in a yell. \u201cI, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion. \u201cI\u2019d do something in the jail that \u2019ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I\u2019d fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I should have such strength,\u201d muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm, \u201cthat I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould I!\u201d said the housebreaker. \u201cTry me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who,\u201d replied Sikes impatiently. \u201cWhoever it was, I\u2019d serve them the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nFagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him. Sikes leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBolter, Bolter! Poor lad!\u201d said Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis. \u201cHe\u2019s tired\u2014tired with watching for her so long,\u2014watching for her, Bill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d asked Sikes, drawing back.\r\n\r\nFagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a sitting posture. When his assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me that again\u2014once again, just for him to hear,\u201d said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell yer what?\u201d asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat about\u2014 Nancy,\u201d said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. \u201cYou followed her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo London Bridge?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere she met two people.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo she did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did\u2014and to describe him, which she did\u2014and to tell her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did\u2014and where it could be best watched from, which she did\u2014and what time the people went there, which she did. She did all this. She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur\u2014she did\u2014did she not?\u201d cried Fagin, half mad with fury.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d replied Noah, scratching his head. \u201cThat\u2019s just what it was!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did they say, about last Sunday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout last Sunday!\u201d replied Noah, considering. \u201cWhy I told yer that before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAgain. Tell it again!\u201d cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey asked her,\u201d said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was, \u201cthey asked her why she didn\u2019t come, last Sunday, as she promised. She said she couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy\u2014why? Tell him that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them of before,\u201d replied Noah.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat more of him?\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cWhat more of the man she had told them of before? Tell him that, tell him that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that she couldn\u2019t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,\u201d said Noah; \u201cand so the first time she went to see the lady, she\u2014ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did\u2014she gave him a drink of laudanum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHell\u2019s fire!\u201d cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. \u201cLet me go!\u201d\r\n\r\nFlinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill, Bill!\u201d cried Fagin, following him hastily. \u201cA word. Only a word.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me out,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me; it\u2019s not safe. Let me out, I say!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHear me speak a word,\u201d rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock. \u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014too\u2014violent, Bill?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other\u2019s faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean,\u201d said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless, \u201cnot too violent for safety. Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.\u201d\r\n\r\nSikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.\r\n\r\nWithout one pause, or moment\u2019s consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door. He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.\r\n\r\nThe girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up!\u201d said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is you, Bill!\u201d said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is,\u201d was the reply. \u201cGet up.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet it be,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. \u201cThere\u2019s enough light for wot I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBill,\u201d said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, \u201cwhy do you look like that at me!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill, Bill!\u201d gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,\u2014\u201cI\u2014I won\u2019t scream or cry\u2014not once\u2014hear me\u2014speak to me\u2014tell me what I have done!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know, you she devil!\u201d returned the robber, suppressing his breath. \u201cYou were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,\u201d rejoined the girl, clinging to him. \u201cBill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you. You shall have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. Bill, Bill, for dear God\u2019s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood! I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away.\r\n\r\n\u201cBill,\u201d cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, \u201cthe gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent. They told me so\u2014I feel it now\u2014but we must have time\u2014a little, little time!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own.\r\n\r\nShe staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief\u2014Rose Maylie\u2019s own\u2014and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker.\r\n\r\nIt was a ghastly figure to look upon. The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck her down.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nTHE FLIGHT OF SIKES\r\n\r\nOf all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London\u2019s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel.\r\n\r\nThe sun\u2014the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man\u2014burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory. Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray. It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in. If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!\r\n\r\nHe had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again. Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. He had plucked it off again. And there was the body\u2014mere flesh and blood, no more\u2014but such flesh, and so much blood!\r\n\r\nHe struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody.\r\n\r\nAll this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.\r\n\r\nHe crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay nearly under there. He knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot!\r\n\r\nThe glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the room. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\nHe went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept.\r\n\r\nSoon he was up again, and away,\u2014not far into the country, but back towards London by the high-road\u2014then back again\u2014then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed\u2014then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches\u2019 brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.\r\n\r\nWhere could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people\u2019s way. Thither he directed his steps,\u2014running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail\u2019s pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when he got there, all the people he met\u2014the very children at the doors\u2014seemed to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go.\r\n\r\nHe wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\u2019clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot. There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it.\r\n\r\nThey made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young\u2014not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he was\u2014with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least\u2014if he had taken care; if he had taken care.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer.\r\n\r\nThis was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back. His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?\u201d asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the fellow, producing one, \u201cthis is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff. Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she\u2019s cured at once\u2014for it\u2019s poison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question\u2014for it\u2019s quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one penny a square!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bought up as fast as it can be made,\u201d said the fellow. \u201cThere are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they can\u2019t make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins. One penny a square! Two half-pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square! Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I\u2019ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHah!\u201d cried Sikes starting up. \u201cGive that back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it clean out, sir,\u201d replied the man, winking to the company, \u201cbefore you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman\u2019s hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.\r\n\r\nWith the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office. He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened.\r\n\r\nThe guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for your people,\u201d said the guard. \u201cNow, look alive in there, will you. Damn that \u2019ere bag, it warn\u2019t ready night afore last; this won\u2019t do, you know!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything new up in town, Ben?\u201d asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, nothing that I knows on,\u201d replied the man, pulling on his gloves. \u201cCorn\u2019s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don\u2019t reckon much upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s quite true,\u201d said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window. \u201cAnd a dreadful murder it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas it, sir?\u201d rejoined the guard, touching his hat. \u201cMan or woman, pray, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA woman,\u201d replied the gentleman. \u201cIt is supposed\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Ben,\u201d replied the coachman impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn that \u2019ere bag,\u201d said the guard; \u201care you gone to sleep in there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cComing!\u201d cried the office keeper, running out.\r\n\r\n\u201cComing,\u201d growled the guard. \u201cAh, and so\u2019s the young \u2019ooman of property that\u2019s going to take a fancy to me, but I don\u2019t know when. Here, give hold. All ri\u2014ight!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.\r\n\r\nSikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go. At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans.\r\n\r\nHe went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning\u2019s ghastly figure following at his heels. He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along. He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry. If he stopped it did the same. If he ran, it followed\u2014not running too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.\r\n\r\nAt times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then. He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now\u2014always. He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky. He threw himself upon the road\u2014on his back upon the road. At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still\u2014a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood.\r\n\r\nLet no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear.\r\n\r\nThere was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night. Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He could not walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall\u2014to undergo new torture.\r\n\r\nFor now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing. There were but two, but they were everywhere. If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object\u2014some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory\u2014each in its accustomed place. The body was in its place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away. He got up, and rushed into the field without. The figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.\r\n\r\nAnd here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him. He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air.\r\n\r\nThe broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food. The noise increased as he looked. There were people there\u2014men and women\u2014light, bustle. It was like new life to him. He darted onward\u2014straight, headlong\u2014dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him.\r\n\r\nHe came upon the spot. There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams. The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground. Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng. Hither and thither he dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained.\r\n\r\nThis mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder. \u201cHe has gone to Birmingham, they say,\u201d said one: \u201cbut they\u2019ll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there\u2019ll be a cry all through the country.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s somebody to speak to there, at all event,\u201d he thought. \u201cA good hiding-place, too. They\u2019ll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent. Why can\u2019t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I\u2019ll risk it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination.\r\n\r\nThe dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.\r\n\r\nThe animal looked up into his master\u2019s face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber\u2019s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along. When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you hear me call? Come here!\u201d cried Sikes.\r\n\r\nThe animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome back!\u201d said the robber.\r\n\r\nThe dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and called him again.\r\n\r\nThe dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed.\r\n\r\nThe man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nMONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT\r\n\r\nThe twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side. At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.\r\n\r\nThey walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr. Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped. The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows the alternative,\u201d said Mr. Browlow. \u201cIf he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you say this of me?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you urge me to it, young man?\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, confronting him with a steady look. \u201cAre you mad enough to leave this house? Unhand him. There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow. But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. I am resolute and immoveable. If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?\u201d asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy mine,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cThose persons are indemnified by me. If you complain of being deprived of your liberty\u2014you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet\u2014I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law. I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will decide quickly,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and composure. \u201cIf you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way. If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has waited for you two whole days.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be prompt,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cA word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\nStill the man hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not the inclination to parley,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there\u2014\u201d demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,\u2014\u201cis there\u2014no middle course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.\r\n\r\n\u201cLock the door on the outside,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, \u201cand come when I ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is pretty treatment, sir,\u201d said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, \u201cfrom my father\u2019s oldest friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is because I was your father\u2019s oldest friend, young man,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow; \u201cit is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters\u2019s death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would\u2014but Heaven willed otherwise\u2014have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now\u2014yes, Edward Leeford, even now\u2014and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has the name to do with it?\u201d asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion. \u201cWhat is the name to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cnothing to you. But it was hers, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger. I am very glad you have changed it\u2014very\u2014very.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is all mighty fine,\u201d said Monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his hand. \u201cBut what do you want with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a brother,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: \u201ca brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no brother,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cYou know I was an only child. Why do you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAttend to what I do know, and you may not,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI shall interest you by and by. I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for hard names,\u201d interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh. \u201cYou know the fact, and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I also know,\u201d pursued the old gentleman, \u201cthe misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both. I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume. Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. But it rusted and cankered at your father\u2019s heart for years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they were separated,\u201d said Monks, \u201cand what of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen they had been separated for some time,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends. This circumstance, at least, you know already.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I,\u201d said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. \u201cNot I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty\u2014for he was, I repeat, a boy, when his father ordered him to marry. Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing to disclose,\u201d rejoined Monks. \u201cYou must talk on if you will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThese new friends, then,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cwere a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year before, and left him with two children\u2014there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this to me?\u201d asked Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey resided,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, \u201cin a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode. Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your father was gifted as few men are. He had his sister\u2019s soul and person. As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him. I would that it had ended there. His daughter did the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour tale is of the longest,\u201d observed Monks, moving restlessly in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief. At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often\u2014it is no uncommon case\u2014died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs\u2014Money. It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion. He went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will\u2014no will\u2014so that the whole property fell to her and you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker. As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other\u2019s face, \u201che came to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never heard of that,\u201d interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture\u2014a portrait painted by himself\u2014a likeness of this poor girl\u2014which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey. He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition, to fly the country\u2014I guessed too well he would not fly alone\u2014and never see it more. Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both\u2014even from me he withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas! That was the last time. I had no letter, and I never saw him more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI went,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, \u201cI went, when all was over, to the scene of his\u2014I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him\u2014of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night. Why, or whither, none can tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen your brother,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other\u2019s chair, \u201cWhen your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy me,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI told you I should interest you before long. I say by me\u2014I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name, although for aught he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears. When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment. Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Monks hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you know it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDenial to me is vain,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI shall show you that I know more than that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014can\u2019t prove anything against me,\u201d stammered Monks. \u201cI defy you to do it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see,\u201d returned the old gentleman with a searching glance. \u201cI lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies\u2014whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother\u2019s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here\u2014I made the voyage. You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where. I returned. Your agents had no clue to your residence. You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy. I wearied them with new applications. I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now you do see me,\u201d said Monks, rising boldly, \u201cwhat then? Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words\u2014justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man\u2019s Brother! You don\u2019t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don\u2019t even know that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; \u201cbut within the last fortnight I have learnt it all. You have a brother; you know it, and him. There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death. It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father. You repaired to the place of his birth. There existed proofs\u2014proofs long suppressed\u2014of his birth and parentage. Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, \u2018the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.\u2019 Unworthy son, coward, liar,\u2014you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,\u2014you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,\u2014you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father\u2019s heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind\u2014you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cevery word that has passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d interposed Monks. \u201cI\u2014I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. I didn\u2019t know the cause. I thought it was a common quarrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the partial disclosure of your secrets,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cWill you disclose the whole?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSet your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before witnesses?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I promise too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRemain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you insist upon that, I\u2019ll do that also,\u201d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must do more than that,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cMake restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love. You have not forgotten the provisions of the will. Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where you please. In this world you need meet no more.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man will be taken,\u201d he cried. \u201cHe will be taken to-night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe murderer?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d replied the other. \u201cHis dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness. Spies are hovering about in every direction. I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape. A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will give fifty more,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. Where is Mr. Maylie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cand mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cwhat of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time. They\u2019re sure of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you made up your mind?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2014will be secret with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will. Remain here till I return. It is your only hope of safety.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey left the room, and the door was again locked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked the doctor in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll that I could hope to do, and even more. Coupling the poor girl\u2019s intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good friend\u2019s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day. Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the meeting. We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest: especially the young lady, who may have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now. But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature. Which way have they taken?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDrive straight to the office and you will be in time,\u201d replied Mr. Losberne. \u201cI will remain here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nTHE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE\r\n\r\nNear to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nTo reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion. The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman\u2019s door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows. Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner. Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect.\r\n\r\nIn such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands Jacob\u2019s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch. It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name. At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him. Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it\u2014as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch.\r\n\r\nIn Jacob\u2019s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke. Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed. The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die. They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob\u2019s Island.\r\n\r\nIn an upper room of one of these houses\u2014a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described\u2014there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence. One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion. This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish,\u201d said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, \u201cthat you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you, blunder-head!\u201d said Kags.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I thought you\u2019d have been a little more glad to see me than this,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, look\u2019e, young gentleman,\u201d said Toby, \u201cwhen a man keeps himself so very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it\u2019s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEspecially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him, that\u2019s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,\u201d added Mr. Kags.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger, turned to Chitling and said,\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was Fagin took then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust at dinner-time\u2014two o\u2019clock this afternoon. Charley and I made our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Bet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,\u201d replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, \u201cand went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital\u2014and there she is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWot\u2019s come of young Bates?\u201d demanded Kags.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d replied Chitling. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken\u2014I went up there and see it with my own eyes\u2014is filled with traps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a smash,\u201d observed Toby, biting his lips. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one will go with this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sessions are on,\u201d said Kags: \u201cif they get the inquest over, and Bolter turns King\u2019s evidence: as of course he will, from what he\u2019s said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he\u2019ll swing in six days from this, by G\u2014!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should have heard the people groan,\u201d said Chitling; \u201cthe officers fought like devils, or they\u2019d have torn him away. He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends. I can see \u2019em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst \u2019em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they\u2019d tear his heart out!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and Sikes\u2019s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street. The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d said Toby when they had returned. \u201cHe can\u2019t be coming here. I\u2014I\u2014hope not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he was coming here, he\u2019d have come with the dog,\u201d said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. \u201cHere! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s drunk it all up, every drop,\u201d said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence. \u201cCovered with mud\u2014lame\u2014half blind\u2014he must have come a long way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere can he have come from!\u201d exclaimed Toby. \u201cHe\u2019s been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he\u2019s been many a time and often. But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u201d\u2014(none of them called the murderer by his old name)\u2014\u201cHe can\u2019t have made away with himself. What do you think?\u201d said Chitling.\r\n\r\nToby shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he had,\u201d said Kags, \u201cthe dog \u2019ud want to lead us away to where he did it. No. I think he\u2019s got out of the country, and left the dog behind. He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody.\r\n\r\nIt being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table. The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position. They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound. They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.\r\n\r\nThey had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung Bates,\u201d said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt himself.\r\n\r\nThe knocking came again. No, it wasn\u2019t he. He never knocked like that.\r\n\r\nCrackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must let him in,\u201d he said, taking up the candle.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there any help for it?\u201d asked the other man in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone. He must come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave us in the dark,\u201d said Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.\r\n\r\nCrackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days\u2019 growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall\u2014as close as it would go\u2014and ground it against it\u2014and sat down.\r\n\r\nNot a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in silence. If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted. When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. They seemed never to have heard its tones before.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow came that dog here?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlone. Three hours ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-night\u2019s paper says that Fagin\u2019s took. Is it true, or a lie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were silent again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn you all!\u201d said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead. \u201cHave you nothing to say to me?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou that keep this house,\u201d said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, \u201cdo you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may stop here, if you think it safe,\u201d returned the person addressed, after some hesitation.\r\n\r\nSikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it: and said, \u201cIs\u2014it\u2014the body\u2014is it buried?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it!\u201d he retorted with the same glance behind him. \u201cWot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?\u2014Who\u2019s that knocking?\u201d\r\n\r\nCrackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him. Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure.\r\n\r\n\u201cToby,\u201d said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me this, downstairs?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad. Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me go into some other room,\u201d said the boy, retreating still farther.\r\n\r\n\u201cCharley!\u201d said Sikes, stepping forward. \u201cDon\u2019t you\u2014don\u2019t you know me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t come nearer me,\u201d answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer\u2019s face. \u201cYou monster!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes\u2019s eyes sunk gradually to the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness you three,\u201d cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke. \u201cWitness you three\u2014I\u2019m not afraid of him\u2014if they come here after him, I\u2019ll give him up; I will. I tell you out at once. He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I\u2019ll give him up. I\u2019d give him up if he was to be boiled alive. Murder! Help! If there\u2019s the pluck of a man among you three, you\u2019ll help me. Murder! Help! Down with him!\u201d\r\n\r\nPouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe three spectators seemed quite stupefied. They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer\u2019s breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his might.\r\n\r\nThe contest, however, was too unequal to last long. Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window. There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps\u2014endless they seemed in number\u2014crossing the nearest wooden bridge. One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement. The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.\r\n\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air. \u201cHe\u2019s here! Break down the door!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the King\u2019s name,\u201d cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder.\r\n\r\n\u201cBreak down the door!\u201d screamed the boy. \u201cI tell you they\u2019ll never open it. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the door!\u201d\r\n\r\nStrokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,\u201d cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. \u201cThat door. Quick!\u201d He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. \u201cIs the downstairs door fast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDouble-locked and chained,\u201d replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe panels\u2014are they strong?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLined with sheet-iron.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the windows too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and the windows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn you!\u201d cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd. \u201cDo your worst! I\u2019ll cheat you yet!\u201d\r\n\r\nOf all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng. Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead. Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, \u201cTwenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Some called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tide,\u201d cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out, \u201cthe tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a long rope. They\u2019re all in front. I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house-top.\r\n\r\nAll the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body. But, from this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.\r\n\r\nHe planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet.\r\n\r\nThe water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.\r\n\r\nThe crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers. Again and again it rose. Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him.\r\n\r\nOn pressed the people from the front\u2014on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house-top. Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it. Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have him now,\u201d cried a man on the nearest bridge. \u201cHurrah!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will give fifty pounds,\u201d cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, \u201cto the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he come to ask me for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was another roar. At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room. The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out. The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased.\r\n\r\nThe man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion.\r\n\r\nRoused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second. He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.\r\n\r\nAt the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down\u2014at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe eyes again!\u201d he cried in an unearthly screech.\r\n\r\nStaggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for five-and-thirty feet. There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand.\r\n\r\nThe old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for God\u2019s sake.\r\n\r\nA dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man\u2019s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his brains.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nAFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY\r\n\r\nThe events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town. Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThey had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree. He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense.\r\n\r\nThe same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne\u2019s assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place. \u201cIt was quite true,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.\u201d So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.\r\n\r\nBut if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee there, there!\u201d cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; \u201cthat\u2019s the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will see him soon,\u201d replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands between her own. \u201cYou shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cand we\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well,\u2014shall we?\u201d\r\n\r\nRose nodded \u201cyes,\u201d for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cIt will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again\u2014I know that too\u2014to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. He said \u2018God bless you\u2019 to me when I ran away,\u201d cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; \u201cand I will say \u2018God bless you\u2019 now, and show him how I love him for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds. There was Sowerberry\u2019s the undertaker\u2019s just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it\u2014there were all the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected\u2014there was Gamfield\u2019s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public-house door\u2014there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street\u2014there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again\u2014there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well\u2014there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream.\r\n\r\nBut it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head\u2014no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep. There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down. Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room. The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping. All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices.\r\n\r\nAt length, when nine o\u2019clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room. Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door. Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a painful task,\u201d said he, \u201cbut these declarations, which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here. I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said the person addressed, turning away his face. \u201cQuick. I have almost done enough, I think. Don\u2019t keep me here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis child,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, \u201cis your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose heart he might have heard. \u201cThat is the bastard child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe term you use,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, \u201cis a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He was born in this town.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the workhouse of this town,\u201d was the sullen reply. \u201cYou have the story there.\u201d He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must have it here, too,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the listeners.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen then! You!\u201d returned Monks. \u201cHis father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her\u2014to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her. He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he died. Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself\u201d; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; \u201cand enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead. One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of the letter?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter?\u2014A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery\u2014to be explained one day\u2014prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back. She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement. He told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his. He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her\u2014prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before\u2014and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted. I believe he had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver\u2019s tears fell fast.\r\n\r\nMonks was silent.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, \u201cwas in the same spirit as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions\u2014one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age. If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the mother, and his conviction\u2014only strengthened by approaching death\u2014that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature. If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d said Monks, in a louder tone, \u201cdid what a woman should have done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot. The girl\u2019s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate\u2014I love her for it now\u2014could add. Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed. The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative.\r\n\r\n\u201cYears after this,\u201d he said, \u201cthis man\u2019s\u2014Edward Leeford\u2019s\u2014mother came to me. He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts. She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died. Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to France.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere she died,\u201d said Monks, \u201cafter a lingering illness; and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved\u2014though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive. I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot. She was right. He came in my way at last. I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe locket and ring?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,\u201d answered Monks without raising his eyes. \u201cYou know what became of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo my hi\u2019s deceive me!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm, \u201cor is that little Oliver? Oh O-li-ver, if you know\u2019d how I\u2019ve been a-grieving for you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your tongue, fool,\u201d murmured Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?\u201d remonstrated the workhouse master. \u201cCan\u2019t I be supposed to feel\u2014I as brought him up porochially\u2014when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description! I always loved that boy as if he\u2019d been my\u2014my\u2014my own grandfather,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison. \u201cMaster Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, sir,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; \u201csuppress your feelings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do my endeavours, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cHow do you do, sir? I hope you are very well.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple. He inquired, as he pointed to Monks,\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know that person?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw him in all my life,\u201d said Mr. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor sold him anything, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cWhy are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shut the door the night old Sally died,\u201d said the foremost one, raising her shrivelled hand, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t shut out the sound, nor stop the chinks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe heard her try to tell you what she\u2019d done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker\u2019s shop,\u201d said the first.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d added the second, \u201cand it was a \u2018locket and gold ring.\u2019 We found out that, and saw it given you. We were by. Oh! we were by.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd we know more than that,\u201d resumed the first, \u201cfor she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like to see the pawnbroker himself?\u201d asked Mr. Grimwig with a motion towards the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cif he\u201d\u2014she pointed to Monks\u2014\u201chas been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say. I did sell them, and they\u2019re where you\u2019ll never get them. What then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cexcept that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. You may leave the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: \u201cI hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed it will,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYou may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all Mrs. Bumble. She would do it,\u201d urged Mr. Bumble; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is no excuse,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYou were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the law supposes that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, \u201cthe law is a ass\u2014a idiot. If that\u2019s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience\u2014by experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate downstairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung lady,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, \u201cgive me your hand. Do not tremble. You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf they have\u2014I do not know how they can, but if they have\u2014any reference to me,\u201d said Rose, \u201cpray let me hear them at some other time. I have not strength or spirits now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; \u201cyou have more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young lady, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never saw you before,\u201d said Rose faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen you often,\u201d returned Monks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe father of the unhappy Agnes had two daughters,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cWhat was the fate of the other\u2014the child?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe child,\u201d replied Monks, \u201cwhen her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced\u2014the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. \u201cGo on!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t find the spot to which these people had repaired,\u201d said Monks, \u201cbut where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. My mother found it, after a year of cunning search\u2014ay, and found the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe took it, did she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. The people were poor and began to sicken\u2014at least the man did\u2014of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never meant to send. She didn\u2019t quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child\u2019s unhappiness, but told the history of the sister\u2019s shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other. The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home. There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy. I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you see her now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Leaning on your arm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not the less my niece,\u201d cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms; \u201cnot the less my dearest child. I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own dear girl!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe only friend I ever had,\u201d cried Rose, clinging to her. \u201cThe kindest, best of friends. My heart will burst. I cannot bear all this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, embracing her tenderly. \u201cCome, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here\u2014look, look, my dear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot aunt,\u201d cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; \u201cI\u2019ll never call her aunt\u2014sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!\u201d\r\n\r\nLet the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment. Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain.\r\n\r\nThey were a long, long time alone. A soft tap at the door, at length announced that some one was without. Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to Harry Maylie.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it all,\u201d he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. \u201cDear Rose, I know it all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not here by accident,\u201d he added after a lengthened silence; \u201cnor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday\u2014only yesterday. Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStay,\u201d said Rose. \u201cYou do know all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to press you to alter your determination,\u201d pursued the young man, \u201cbut to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,\u201d said Rose firmly. \u201cIf I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night? It is a struggle,\u201d said Rose, \u201cbut one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe disclosure of to-night,\u201d\u2014Harry began.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe disclosure of to-night,\u201d replied Rose softly, \u201cleaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou harden your heart against me, Rose,\u201d urged her lover.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Harry, Harry,\u201d said the young lady, bursting into tears; \u201cI wish I could, and spare myself this pain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why inflict it on yourself?\u201d said Harry, taking her hand. \u201cThink, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what have I heard! What have I heard!\u201d cried Rose. \u201cThat a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all\u2014there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet, not yet,\u201d said the young man, detaining her as she rose. \u201cMy hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my love for you: have undergone a change. I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home\u2014a heart and home\u2014yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean!\u201d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean but this\u2014that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it. This I have done. Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right. Such power and patronage: such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England\u2019s richest county; and by one village church\u2014mine, Rose, my own!\u2014there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold. This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time. Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word in extenuation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, \u201cfor I began to think I should get nothing else. I\u2019ll take the liberty, if you\u2019ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a clergyman.\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver, my child,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cwhere have you been, and why do you look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this moment. What is the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.\r\n\r\nPoor Dick was dead!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nFAGIN\u2019S LAST NIGHT ALIVE\r\n\r\nThe court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man\u2014Fagin. Before him and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury. At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.\r\n\r\nA slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round, he saw that the jurymen had turned together, to consider their verdict. As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence. A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay. But in no one face\u2014not even among the women, of whom there were many there\u2014could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned.\r\n\r\nAs he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge. Hush!\r\n\r\nThey only sought permission to retire.\r\n\r\nHe looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.\r\n\r\nHe looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot. There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book. He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back. He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another.\r\n\r\nNot that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it. Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was. Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold\u2014and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it\u2014and then went on to think again.\r\n\r\nAt length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. Perfect stillness ensued\u2014not a rustle\u2014not a breath\u2014Guilty.\r\n\r\nThe building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man\u2014an old man\u2014and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again.\r\n\r\nThe judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away. He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nThey led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. There was nobody there to speak to him; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed. He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.\r\n\r\nHere, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there\u2014alone.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered. To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead\u2014that was the end. To be hanged by the neck till he was dead.\r\n\r\nAs it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He had seen some of them die,\u2014and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes!\r\n\r\nSome of them might have inhabited that very cell\u2014sat upon that very spot. It was very dark; why didn\u2019t they bring a light? The cell had been built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last hours there. It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies\u2014the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.\u2014Light, light!\r\n\r\nAt length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more.\r\n\r\nThen came the night\u2014dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day. To him they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound\u2014Death. What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.\r\n\r\nThe day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as come\u2014and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off.\r\n\r\nSaturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought of this, the day broke\u2014Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. He had sat there, awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they\u2014used to such sights\u2014recoiled from him with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.\r\n\r\nHe cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight\u2014nine\u2014then. If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other\u2019s heels, where would he be, when they came round again! Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven\u2014\r\n\r\nThose dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that. The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him.\r\n\r\nFrom early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received. These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene. By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.\r\n\r\nThe space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the lodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the young gentleman to come too, sir?\u201d said the man whose duty it was to conduct them. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sight for children, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not indeed, my friend,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \u201cbut my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well\u2014even at the cost of some pain and fear\u2014that he should see him now.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence\u2014\u201cthis is the place he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men\u2019s voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards. They were putting up the scaffold.\r\n\r\nFrom this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell. They did so.\r\n\r\nThe condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy, Charley\u2014well done\u2014\u201d he mumbled. \u201cOliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver too\u2014quite the gentleman now\u2014quite the\u2014take that boy away to bed!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him away to bed!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cDo you hear me, some of you? He has been the\u2014the\u2014somehow the cause of all this. It\u2019s worth the money to bring him up to it\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat, Bill; never mind the girl\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head off!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFagin,\u201d said the jailer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. \u201cAn old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down. \u201cHere\u2019s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shan\u2019t be one long,\u201d he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror. \u201cStrike them all dead! What right have they to butcher me?\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there.\r\n\r\n\u201cSteady,\u201d said the turnkey, still holding him down. \u201cNow, sir, tell him what you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have some papers,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow advancing, \u201cwhich were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a lie together,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cI haven\u2019t one\u2014not one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the love of God,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, \u201cdo not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain. Where are those papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOliver,\u201d cried Fagin, beckoning to him. \u201cHere, here! Let me whisper to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not afraid,\u201d said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers,\u201d said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, \u201care in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I want to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d returned Oliver. \u201cLet me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOutside, outside,\u201d replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head. \u201cSay I\u2019ve gone to sleep\u2014they\u2019ll believe you. You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! God forgive this wretched man!\u201d cried the boy with a burst of tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cThat\u2019ll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don\u2019t you mind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you nothing else to ask him, sir?\u201d inquired the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo other question,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cIf I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing will do that, sir,\u201d replied the man, shaking his head. \u201cYou had better leave him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.\r\n\r\n\u201cPress on, press on,\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cSoftly, but not so slow. Faster, faster!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk.\r\n\r\nDay was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking. Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all\u2014the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nAND LAST\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words.\r\n\r\nBefore three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman\u2019s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know\u2014the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father\u2019s will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded.\r\n\r\nMonks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin\u2019s gang.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver\u2019s warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.\r\n\r\nSoon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor\u2019s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity. In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.\r\n\r\nBefore his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman\u2019s face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so. It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.\r\n\r\nMr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work. After some consideration, he went into business as an informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong.\r\n\r\nMaster Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes\u2019s crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer\u2019s drudge, and a carrier\u2019s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures.\r\n\r\nI would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister\u2019s child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech\u2014I would fain recall them every one.\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become\u2014how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing\u2014how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them\u2014these are all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.\r\n\r\nWithin the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: \u201cAGNES.\u201d There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love\u2014the love beyond the grave\u2014of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLIVER TWIST ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from men\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n\r\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\u2014I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\r\n\r\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it said, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine that it means?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d with a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019 which is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like our \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \u2018Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from all quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of the window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\r\n\r\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he, \u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor. \u201cThe august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI should be better able to advise you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d he cried; \u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes! Retired from operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in London\u2014quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. But how\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImitated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sign of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. \u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\u201d returned the King reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ruin me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am about to be married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go\u2014none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn. \u201cThat is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, as to money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have carte blanche.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd for present expenses?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\u2019s Wood.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of it. \u201cOne other question,\u201d said he. \u201cWas the photograph a cabinet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\u201d he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \u201cIf you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\u2019clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\u201d\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\u2019clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\u2019s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am following you closely,\u201d I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\u2014evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \u2018Drive like the devil,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018first to Gross & Hankey\u2019s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\u2019t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Church of St. Monica, John,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \u2018The Church of St. Monica,\u2019 said I, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy cabby drove fast. I don\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You\u2019ll do. Come! Come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What then?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\u2019t be legal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\u201d said I; \u201cand what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \u2018I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\u2019 she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\u201d he answered, ringing the bell. \u201cI have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be delighted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in a good cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I am your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is it you wish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\u201d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \u201cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to be neutral?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when I raise my hand\u2014so\u2014you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is nothing very formidable,\u201d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \u201cIt is an ordinary plumber\u2019s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may entirely rely on me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \u201cthis marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\u2019s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it has twice been burgled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw! They did not know how to look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how will you look?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will get her to show me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she will refuse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman. \u201cThey would have had the lady\u2019s purse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can\u2019t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\u201d\r\n\r\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids\u2014joined in a general shriek of \u201cFire!\u201d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\u2019s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNothing could have been better. It is all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have the photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe showed me, as I told you she would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not wish to make a mystery,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cThe matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat also I could fathom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will you call?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that voice before,\u201d said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \u201cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\u201d\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have really got it!\u201d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must have a cab.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\u201d We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene Adler is married,\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried! When?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut to whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she could not love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am in hopes that she does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why in hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\u2019s plan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true. And yet\u2014! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Mr. Holmes,\u201d answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \u201cDo you mean that she has left England?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever to return.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the papers?\u201d asked the King hoarsely. \u201cAll is lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \u201cSherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\u201d My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\r\n    \u201cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\r\n    \u201cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\n\r\n\u201cVery truly yours,\r\n\u201cIRENE NORTON, n\u00e9e ADLER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201d cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \u201cDid I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\u201d said Holmes coldly. \u201cI am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\u2019s business to a more successful conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\u201d cried the King; \u201cnothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring\u2014\u201d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have but to name it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis photograph!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201cIrene\u2019s photograph!\u201d he cried. \u201cCertainly, if you wish it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.\u201d He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\u2019s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\u201d he said cordially.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid that you were engaged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. Very much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I can wait in the next room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry the settee,\u201d said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \u201cI know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\u201d I observed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\r\n\r\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\u2019s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \u201cBeyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It\u2019s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\u2019s carpenter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, but China?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\u2019 scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \u201cWell, I never!\u201d said he. \u201cI thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI begin to think, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I make a mistake in explaining. \u2018Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\u2019 you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have got it now,\u201d he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \u201cHere it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of \u00a3 4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o\u2019clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\u2019s Court, Fleet Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth does this mean?\u201d I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \u201cIt is a little off the beaten track, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said he. \u201cAnd now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \u201cI have a small pawnbroker\u2019s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\u2019s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\u2019s not such a youth, either. It\u2019s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ\u00e9 who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don\u2019t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he has his faults, too,\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cNever was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he\u2019s a good worker. There\u2019s no vice in him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is still with you, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean\u2014that\u2019s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why that?\u2019 I asks.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why,\u2019 says he, \u2018here\u2019s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\u2019s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\u2019 end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\u2019s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what is it, then?\u2019 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\u2019t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\u2019 he asked with his eyes open.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what are they worth?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\u2019s other occupations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me all about it,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said he, showing me the advertisement, \u2018you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not so many as you might think,\u2019 he answered. \u2018You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\u2019s Court looked like a coster\u2019s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were\u2014straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\u201d remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \u201cPray continue your very interesting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant, \u2018and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\u2019 He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said he. \u2018You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\u2019 With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. \u2018There is water in your eyes,\u2019 said he as he released me. \u2018I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\u2019s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\u2019 He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My name,\u2019 said he, \u2018is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI answered that I had not.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis face fell immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me!\u2019 he said gravely, \u2018that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cMy face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In the case of another,\u2019 said he, \u2018the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\u2019 said Vincent Spaulding. \u2018I should be able to look after that for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What would be the hours?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ten to two.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cNow a pawnbroker\u2019s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That would suit me very well,\u2019 said I. \u2018And the pay?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is \u00a3 4 a week.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is purely nominal.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What do you call purely nominal?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don\u2019t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No excuse will avail,\u2019 said Mr. Duncan Ross; \u2018neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is to copy out the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\u2019 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\u2019s Court.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\u2019clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\u2019s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\u2019s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an end?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o\u2019clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\r\n\r\n\u201cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,\u201d cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \u201cIf you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018the gentleman at No. 4.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, the red-headed man?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where could I find him?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\u2019s.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you did very wisely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGrave enough!\u201d said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \u201cWhy, I have lost four pound a week.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as you are personally concerned,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cI do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \u00a3 30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank\u2014if it was a prank\u2014upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement\u2014how long had he been with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout a month then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did he come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn answer to an advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he the only applicant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I had a dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you pick him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he was handy and would come cheap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt half wages, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\u2019s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \u201cI thought as much,\u201d said he. \u201cHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \u201cHe is still with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to complain of, sir. There\u2019s never very much to do of a morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Watson,\u201d said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \u201cwhat do you make of it all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI make nothing of it,\u201d I answered frankly. \u201cIt is a most mysterious business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a rule,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthe more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo smoke,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\u2019t speak to me for fifty minutes.\u201d He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\u201cSarasate plays at the St. James\u2019s Hall this afternoon,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with \u201cJABEZ WILSON\u201d in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\u2019s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThird right, fourth left,\u201d answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cSmart fellow, that,\u201d observed Holmes as we walked away. \u201cHe is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvidently,\u201d said I, \u201cMr. Wilson\u2019s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe knees of his trousers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I expected to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you beat the pavement?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\u2019s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \u201cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer\u2019s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\u2019s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we\u2019ve done our work, so it\u2019s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\u2019s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\u201d he remarked as we emerged.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would be as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy serious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt what time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen will be early enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\u201d He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\r\n\r\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclop\u00e6dia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\u2019s assistant was a formidable man\u2014a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! Our party is complete,\u201d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \u201cWatson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\u2019s adventure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\u201d said Jones in his consequential way. \u201cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\u201d observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\u201d said the police agent loftily. \u201cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he won\u2019t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\u201d said the stranger with deference. \u201cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you will find,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cthat you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some \u00a3 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\u2019s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\u2019s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He\u2019ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I\u2019ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\u2019ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are close there now,\u201d my friend remarked. \u201cThis fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\u201d Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNor from below,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \u201cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\u201d he remarked, looking up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\u201d said Holmes severely. \u201cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have at least an hour before us,\u201d he remarked, \u201cfor they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor\u2014as no doubt you have divined\u2014in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our French gold,\u201d whispered the director. \u201cWe have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour French gold?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich were very well justified,\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cAnd now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd sit in the dark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carr\u00e9e, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy\u2019s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness\u2014such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\u2019s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have but one retreat,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cThat is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\r\n\r\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\r\n\r\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all clear,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHave you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\u2019ll swing for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\u2019 hunting crop came down on the man\u2019s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use, John Clay,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cYou have no chance at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I see,\u201d the other answered with the utmost coolness. \u201cI fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cYour red-headed idea was very new and effective.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see your pal again presently,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\u201d remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \u201cYou may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \u201cWell, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is better,\u201d said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \u201cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Watson,\u201d he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \u201cit was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclop\u00e6dia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\u2019s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\u2019s hair. The \u00a3 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\u2019s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\u2019s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar\u2014something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\u2019s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\u2019s presence\u2014in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\u201d I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \u201cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt saved me from ennui,\u201d he answered, yawning. \u201cAlas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\u201d he remarked. \u201c\u2018L\u2019homme c\u2019est rien\u2014l\u2019\u0153uvre c\u2019est tout,\u2019 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\u201d\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nA CASE OF IDENTITY\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \u201clife is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outr\u00e9 results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\u201d I answered. \u201cThe cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cThis is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI smiled and shook my head. \u201cI can quite understand your thinking so,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here\u201d\u2014I picked up the morning paper from the ground\u2014\u201clet us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \u2018A husband\u2019s cruelty to his wife.\u2019 There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\u201d said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \u201cThis is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the ring?\u201d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd have you any on hand just now?\u201d I asked with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen those symptoms before,\u201d said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. \u201cOscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de c\u0153ur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not find,\u201d he said, \u201cthat with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did at first,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut now I know where the letters are without looking.\u201d Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,\u201d she cried, \u201celse how could you know all that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Holmes, laughing; \u201cit is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\u2019m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \u201cYes, I did bang out of the house,\u201d she said, \u201cfor it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\u2014that is, my father\u2014took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyour stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\u2019t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father\u2019s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got \u00a3 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\u2019t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it come out of the business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\u00bd per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \u00a3 60.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\u2019t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have made your position very clear to me,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\u2019s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. \u201cI met him first at the gasfitters\u2019 ball,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\u2019s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Then at the gasfitters\u2019 ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him\u2014that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know father didn\u2019t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\u2019t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer\u2014Mr. Angel\u2014was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did he live, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe slept on the premises.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know his address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014except that it was Leadenhall Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you address your letters, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\u2019t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was most suggestive,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\u2019d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn\u2019t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\u2019t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt missed him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\u2019s, near King\u2019s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more question. How did your mother take the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father? Did you tell him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\u2019t sleep a wink at night.\u201d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall glance into the case for you,\u201d said Holmes, rising, \u201cand I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see him again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what has happened to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI advertised for him in last Saturday\u2019s Chronicle,\u201d said she. \u201cHere is the slip and here are four letters from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. And your address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Angel\u2019s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father\u2019s place of business?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\u201d he observed. \u201cI found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \u201977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman\u2019s appearance? Describe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\u2019t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman\u2019s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\u2019s incisive reasoning.\r\n\r\n\u201cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\nI held the little printed slip to the light. \u201cMissing,\u201d it said, \u201con the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,\u201d &c, &c.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAs to the letters,\u201d he continued, glancing over them, \u201cthey are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are typewritten,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little \u2018Hosmer Angel\u2019 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive\u2014in fact, we may call it conclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\u2019s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\u2019clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\u2019s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\r\n\r\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\r\n\r\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o\u2019clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the d\u00e9nouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d I asked as I entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, the mystery!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the girl\u2019s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cI think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\u2019clock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes quietly; \u201cI have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \u201cI am delighted to hear it,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a curious thing,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cthat a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\u2019s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \u2018e,\u2019 and a slight defect in the tail of the \u2018r.\u2019 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,\u201d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,\u201d Holmes continued. \u201cI think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \u2018e\u2019s\u2019 slurred and the \u2018r\u2019s\u2019 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \u201cI cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. \u201cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! where?\u201d shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it won\u2019t do\u2014really it won\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes suavely. \u201cThere is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\u2019s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s not actionable,\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\u201d said he, \u201cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\u2019s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only a joke at first,\u201d groaned our visitor. \u201cWe never thought that she would have been so carried away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\u2019s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\u2019s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cbut if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\u201d said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \u201cyet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\u201d he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\u2019s face, \u201cit is not part of my duties to my client, but here\u2019s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to\u2014\u201d He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\u201d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. \u201cThat fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you verify them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise\u2014the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ\u00e9, James Windibank. Voil\u00e0 tout!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Miss Sutherland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, \u2018There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\u2019 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\r\n\r\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you say, dear?\u201d said my wife, looking across at me. \u201cWill you go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 cases.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really very good of you to come, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you heard anything of the case?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat sounds a little paradoxical.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a murder, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\u2014a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\u2019s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \u2018wilful murder\u2019 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly imagine a more damning case,\u201d I remarked. \u201cIf ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCircumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\u201d answered Holmes thoughtfully. \u201cIt may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said I, \u201cthat the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\u201d he answered, laughing. \u201cBesides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my m\u00e9tier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\u2019s jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a confession,\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cComing on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cit is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cMany men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the young man\u2019s own account of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \u2018I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \u201cCooee!\u201d which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\u2019s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What did you understand by that?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I should prefer not to answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I must still refuse.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: I understand that the cry of \u2018Cooee\u2019 was a common signal between you and your father?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: It was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: Nothing definite.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Coroner: What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\u201cWitness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, it was gone.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c \u2018You cannot say what it was?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I had a feeling something was there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How far from the body?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018A dozen yards or so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And how far from the edge of the wood?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018About the same.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but with my back towards it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said I as I glanced down the column, \u201cthat the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\u2019s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. \u201cBoth you and the coroner have been at some pains,\u201d said he, \u201cto single out the very strongest points in the young man\u2019s favour. Don\u2019t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr\u00e9 as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have ordered a carriage,\u201d said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. \u201cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cIt is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked startled. \u201cI do not quite follow,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \u201cYou have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can\u2019t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\u201d she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\u2019s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \u201cI am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\u2019t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou may rely upon my doing all that I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that it is very probable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, now!\u201d she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \u201cYou hear! He gives me hopes.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and\u2014and\u2014well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cWas he in favour of such a union?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.\u201d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for this information,\u201d said he. \u201cMay I see your father if I call to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid the doctor won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! In Victoria! That is important.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, at the mines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will, Miss Turner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\u201d She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\u201d said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\u2019 silence. \u201cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHave you an order to see him in prison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but only for you and me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmple.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\u2019s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\u2019s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\u2019 attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\u2019s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence.\r\n\r\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe glass still keeps very high,\u201d he remarked as he sat down. \u201cIt is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did you learn from him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould he throw no light?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot admire his taste,\u201d I remarked, \u201cif it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o\u2019clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is serious news this morning,\u201d Lestrade observed. \u201cIt is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn elderly man, I presume?\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\u2019s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is interesting,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\u2019s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\u201d said Lestrade, winking at me. \u201cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,\u201d replied Lestrade with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\u2019 request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\u2019s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\r\n\r\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\u2019s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\u201d He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \u201cThese are young McCarthy\u2019s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\u2019s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again\u2014of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\u201d He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\u201d he remarked, returning to his natural manner. \u201cI fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\u201d he remarked, holding it out. \u201cThe murder was done with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see no marks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the murderer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed. \u201cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\u201d he said. \u201cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNous verrons,\u201d answered Holmes calmly. \u201cYou work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd leave your case unfinished?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the mystery?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is solved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was the criminal, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gentleman I describe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am a practical man,\u201d he said, \u201cand I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cI have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth was cleared \u201cjust sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\u2019t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\u2019s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\u2019s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of this \u2018Cooee!\u2019 then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \u2018Cooee!\u2019 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But \u2018Cooee\u2019 is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat of the rat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. \u201cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\u201d he said. \u201cI wired to Bristol for it last night.\u201d He put his hand over part of the map. \u201cWhat do you read?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cARAT,\u201d I read.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d He raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBALLARAT.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\u2019s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how did you gain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they were peculiar boots.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his lameness?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\u2014he was lame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his left-handedness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. John Turner,\u201d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray sit down on the sofa,\u201d said Holmes gently. \u201cYou had my note?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why did you wish to see me?\u201d He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \u201cIt is so. I know all about McCarthy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \u201cGod help me!\u201d he cried. \u201cBut I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Holmes gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart\u2014it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may not come to that,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a dying man,\u201d said old Turner. \u201cI have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. \u201cJust tell us the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well,\u201d said the old man; \u201cit\u2019s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\u2019ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Here we are, Jack,\u2019 says he, touching me on the arm; \u2018we\u2019ll be as good as a family to you. There\u2019s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\u2019s always a policeman within hail.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\u201d said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. \u201cI pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, then,\u201d said the old man solemnly. \u201cYour own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\u201d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod help us!\u201d said Holmes after a long silence. \u201cWhy does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\u2019s words, and say, \u2018There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\r\n\r\nV.\r\nTHE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\r\n\r\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \u201982 and \u201990, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe year \u201987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\u2019s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\u2014a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\u2019s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\u2019s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said I, glancing up at my companion, \u201cthat was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept yourself I have none,\u201d he answered. \u201cI do not encourage visitors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA client, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. \u201cI trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me your coat and umbrella,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, from Horsham.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come for advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is easily got.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not always so easy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said that you could solve anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said too much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you are never beaten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been beaten four times\u2014three times by men, and once by a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that I have been generally successful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you may be so with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no ordinary one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou fill me with interest,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cPray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d said he, \u201cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know that my grandfather had two sons\u2014my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\u2019s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\u2019s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne day\u2014it was in March, 1883\u2014a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\u2019s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \u2018From India!\u2019 said he as he took it up, \u2018Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\u2019 Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \u2018K. K. K.!\u2019 he shrieked, and then, \u2018My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What is it, uncle?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Death,\u2019 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018They may do what they like, but I\u2019ll checkmate them still,\u2019 said he with an oath. \u2018Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I wish you, John,\u2019 said my uncle, \u2018to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\u2019t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \u2018suicide.\u2019 But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some \u00a3 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Holmes interposed, \u201cyour statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. Pray proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and \u2018Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\u2019 written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\u2019s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was the beginning of \u201984 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \u201985. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\u2019 he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy heart had turned to lead. \u2018It is K. K. K.,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked inside the envelope. \u2018So it is,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Put the papers on the sundial,\u2019 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What papers? What sundial?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\u2019 said I; \u2018but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Pooh!\u2019 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \u2018We are in a civilised land here, and we can\u2019t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018From Dundee,\u2019 I answered, glancing at the postmark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some preposterous practical joke,\u2019 said he. \u2018What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should certainly speak to the police,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then let me do so?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I forbid you. I won\u2019t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \u2018death from accidental causes.\u2019 Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\u2019s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was in January, \u201985, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the envelope,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe postmark is London\u2014eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father\u2019s last message: \u2018K. K. K.\u2019; and then \u2018Put the papers on the sundial.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell the truth\u201d\u2014he sank his face into his thin, white hands\u2014\u201cI have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut! tut!\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes. \u201cYou must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \u201cIncredible imbecility!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he come with you to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. His orders were to stay in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d he said, \u201cand, above all, why did you not come at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us\u2014no suggestive detail which might help us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one thing,\u201d said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \u201cI have some remembrance,\u201d said he, \u201cthat on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, \u201cMarch, 1869,\u201d and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\r\n\r\n\u201c4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\r\n\r\n\u201c7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\u201c9th. McCauley cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c10th. John Swain cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201c12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. \u201cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. \u201cYou have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy train from Waterloo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am armed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall see you at Horsham, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\u201d He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements\u2014blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\u2014and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, Watson,\u201d he remarked at last, \u201cthat of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut have you,\u201d I asked, \u201cformed any definite conception as to what these perils are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere can be no question as to their nature,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \u201cThe ideal reasoner,\u201d he remarked, \u201cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclop\u00e6dias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, laughing. \u201cIt was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclop\u00e6dia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom East London. What do you deduce from that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability\u2014the strong probability\u2014is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA greater distance to travel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I do not see the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\u2019s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut of what society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you never\u2014\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice\u2014\u201chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never have.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \u201cHere it is,\u201d said he presently:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape\u2014a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will observe,\u201d said Holmes, laying down the volume, \u201cthat the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the page we have seen\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \u2018sent the pips to A, B, and C\u2019\u2014that is, sent the society\u2019s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me for not waiting for you,\u201d said he; \u201cI have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat steps will you take?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not go there first?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou are too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said he, laying down his cup, \u201cI feared as much. How was it done?\u201d He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \u2018Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\u2019 Here is the account:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\u2014!\u201d He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must be cunning devils,\u201d he exclaimed at last. \u201cHow could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\u2019clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are hungry,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cStarving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bite. I had no time to think of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how have you succeeded?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a clue?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \u201cS. H. for J. O.\u201d Then he sealed it and addressed it to \u201cCaptain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will await him when he enters port,\u201d said he, chuckling. \u201cIt may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is this Captain Calhoun?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you trace it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have spent the whole day,\u201d said he, \u201cover Lloyd\u2019s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \u201983. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTexas, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, \u201985, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you do, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \u201cL. S.\u201d carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\r\n\r\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George\u2019s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey\u2019s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\r\n\r\nOne night\u2014it was in June, \u201989\u2014there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201cA patient!\u201d said she. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go out.\u201d\r\n\r\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\r\n\r\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my calling so late,\u201d she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\u2019s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \u201cOh, I\u2019m in such trouble!\u201d she cried; \u201cI do so want a little help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said my wife, pulling up her veil, \u201cit is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\u201d That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, no! I want the doctor\u2019s advice and help, too. It\u2019s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\u2019s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\r\n\r\nIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\r\n\r\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\u2019s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.\r\n\r\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\r\n\r\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have not come to stay,\u201d said I. \u201cThere is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! It\u2019s Watson,\u201d said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \u201cI say, Watson, what o\u2019clock is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNearly eleven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf Friday, June 19th.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\u2019you want to frighten a chap for?\u201d He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I am. But you\u2019ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes\u2014I forget how many. But I\u2019ll go home with you. I wouldn\u2019t frighten Kate\u2014poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have one waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \u201cWalk past me, and then look back at me.\u201d The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes!\u201d I whispered, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs low as you can,\u201d he answered; \u201cI have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a cab outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\u2019s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was certainly surprised to find you there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not more so than I to find you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI came to find a friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I to find an enemy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn enemy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\u2019s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul\u2019s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! You do not mean bodies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had \u00a3 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\u201d He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\u2014a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\u2019 hoofs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can be of use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Cedars?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; that is Mr. St. Clair\u2019s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNear Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am all in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you are. You\u2019ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here\u2019s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \u2019Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget that I know nothing about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There\u2019s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\u2019t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\u2019ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProceed, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome years ago\u2014to be definite, in May, 1884\u2014there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to \u00a3 88 10s., while he has \u00a3 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\u2019s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\r\n\r\n\u201cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\u2014for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night\u2014and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children\u2019s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\u2014all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\u2019s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a cripple!\u201d said I. \u201cWhat could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue your narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\u2019s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies\u2014421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\u2019s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt certainly sounds feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\u2014what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance\u2014are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,\u201d said my companion. \u201cWe have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\u2019s feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\u2019s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d she cried, \u201cwell?\u201d And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo good news?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo bad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am delighted to see you,\u201d said she, pressing my hand warmly. \u201cYou will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear madam,\u201d said I, \u201cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \u201cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon what point?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \u201cFrankly, now!\u201d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think that he is dead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMurdered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t say that. Perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on what day did he meet his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he roared.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, to-day.\u201d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoarse writing,\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cSurely this is not your husband\u2019s writing, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but the enclosure is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you are sure that this is your husband\u2019s hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.\u2014NEVILLE.\u2019 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband\u2019s hand, madam?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone. Neville wrote those words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, much may have happened between.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery much so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the window open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he might have called to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA call for help, you thought?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He waved his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you thought he was pulled back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe disappeared so suddenly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\r\n\r\n\u201cAwake, Watson?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGame for a morning drive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\u201d He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\r\n\r\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to test a little theory of mine,\u201d said he, pulling on his boots. \u201cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd where is it?\u201d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh, yes, I am not joking,\u201d he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. \u201cI have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been in some points a singular case,\u201d said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. \u201cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse\u2019s head while the other led us in.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is on duty?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\u201d A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \u201cI wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI called about that beggarman, Boone\u2014the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I heard. You have him here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the cells.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he quiet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\u2019s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to see him very much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I think that I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Come this way, if you please.\u201d He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe third on the right is his,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHere it is!\u201d He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is asleep,\u201d said he. \u201cYou can see him very well.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe certainly needs a wash,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cI had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\u201d He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe! he! You are a funny one,\u201d chuckled the inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why not,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\u201d He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d he shouted, \u201cto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\u201d\r\n\r\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\u2019s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat heavens!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cit is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. \u201cBe it so,\u201d said he. \u201cAnd pray what am I charged with?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith making away with Mr. Neville St.\u2014 Oh, come, you can\u2019t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\u201d said the inspector with a grin. \u201cWell, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not the wife; it was the children,\u201d groaned the prisoner. \u201cGod help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\u201d said he, \u201cof course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you!\u201d cried the prisoner passionately. \u201cI would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for \u00a3 25. I was at my wit\u2019s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\u2019s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at \u00a3 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn \u00a3 700 a year\u2014which is less than my average takings\u2014but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take \u00a3 2.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\u2019s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat note only reached her yesterday,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God! What a week she must have spent!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe police have watched this Lascar,\u201d said Inspector Bradstreet, \u201cand I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \u201cI have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMany times; but what was a fine to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must stop here, however,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cIf the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reached this one,\u201d said my friend, \u201cby sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\r\n\r\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are engaged,\u201d said I; \u201cperhaps I interrupt you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\u201d\u2014he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat\u2014\u201cbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\u201d\r\n\r\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. \u201cI suppose,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\u2014that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. No crime,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cOnly one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much so,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is his hat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\u2019s fire. The facts are these: about four o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\u2019s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich surely he restored to their owner?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \u2018For Mrs. Henry Baker\u2019 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\u2019s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \u2018H. B.\u2019 are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he not advertise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly as much as we can deduce.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom his hat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\u2019s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \u201cH. B.\u201d were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see nothing,\u201d said I, handing it back to my friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. \u201cIt is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\u201d he remarked, \u201cand yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\u201d he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. \u201cHe is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt is a question of cubic capacity,\u201d said he; \u201ca man with so large a brain must have something in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \u201cHere is the foresight,\u201d said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \u201cThey are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his wife\u2014you said that she had ceased to love him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week\u2019s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\u2019s affection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he might be a bachelor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird\u2019s leg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow\u2014walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is very ingenious,\u201d said I, laughing; \u201cbut since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?\u201d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man\u2019s excited face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\u201d He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \u201cBy Jove, Peterson!\u201d said he, \u201cthis is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the Countess of Morcar\u2019s blue carbuncle!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of \u00a3 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\u201d The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\u2019s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.\u201d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\u201cHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\u2019s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! So much for the police-court,\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. \u201cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \u2018Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.\u2019 That is clear and concise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery. But will he see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn which, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James\u2019s Gazette, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, sir. And this stone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonny thing,\u201d said he. \u201cJust see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil\u2019s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I\u2019ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can do nothing until then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes\u2019 room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Henry Baker, I believe,\u201d said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. \u201cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\u2019 surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have retained these things for some days,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cbecause we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \u201cShillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo eat it!\u201d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, certainly,\u201d answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cThey might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,\u201d said he, \u201cbut beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\u201d said he. \u201cBy the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. \u201cThere are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum\u2014we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\u201d With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for Mr. Henry Baker,\u201d said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. \u201cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\u2019 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy geese!\u201d The man seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\u2019s not our geese.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Whose, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBreckinridge is his name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I don\u2019t know him. Well, here\u2019s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow for Mr. Breckinridge,\u201d he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. \u201cRemember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\u2019 penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-evening. It\u2019s a cold night,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cSold out of geese, I see,\u201d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but I was recommended to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho by?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe landlord of the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, mister,\u201d said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, \u201cwhat are you driving at? Let\u2019s have it straight, now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then, I shan\u2019t tell you. So now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\u2019t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWarm! You\u2019d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it\u2019s \u2018Where are the geese?\u2019 and \u2018Who did you sell the geese to?\u2019 and \u2018What will you take for the geese?\u2019 One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,\u201d said Holmes carelessly. \u201cIf you won\u2019t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I\u2019m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, you\u2019ve lost your fiver, for it\u2019s town bred,\u201d snapped the salesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never persuade me to believe that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you bet, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\u2019ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. \u201cBring me the books, Bill,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, Mr. Cocksure,\u201d said the salesman, \u201cI thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you\u2019ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\u2019you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\u2014249,\u201d read Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. \u201cHere you are, \u2018Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then, what\u2019s the last entry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. There you are. And underneath?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you to say now?\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \u2018Pink \u2019un\u2019 protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\u201d said he. \u201cI daresay that if I had put \u00a3 100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you and your geese,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I\u2019ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I\u2019ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,\u201d whined the little man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe told me to ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\u2019ve had enough of it. Get out of this!\u201d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\u201d whispered Holmes. \u201cCome with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\u201d Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you, then? What do you want?\u201d he asked in a quavering voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me,\u201d said Holmes blandly, \u201cbut I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can know nothing of this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\u201d cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \u201cI can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \u201cIn that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,\u201d said he. \u201cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated for an instant. \u201cMy name is John Robinson,\u201d he answered with a sidelong glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; the real name,\u201d said Holmes sweetly. \u201cIt is always awkward doing business with an alias.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \u201cWell then,\u201d said he, \u201cmy real name is James Ryder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. \u201cThe fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested\u2014white, with a black bar across the tail.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder quivered with emotion. \u201cOh, sir,\u201d he cried, \u201ccan you tell me where it went to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt came here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\u2019t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\u2014the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe game\u2019s up, Ryder,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cHold up, man, or you\u2019ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\u2019s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\u201d said he in a crackling voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see\u2014her ladyship\u2019s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady\u2019s room\u2014you and your confederate Cusack\u2014and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion\u2019s knees. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cThink of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\u2019ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don\u2019t bring it into court! For Christ\u2019s sake, don\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet back into your chair!\u201d said Holmes sternly. \u201cIt is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.\u201d\r\n\r\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \u201cI will tell you it just as it happened, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\u2019s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds\u2014a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\u2019 says she.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018you said you\u2019d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 says she, \u2018we\u2019ve set yours aside for you\u2014Jem\u2019s bird, we call it. It\u2019s the big white one over yonder. There\u2019s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Thank you, Maggie,\u2019 says I; \u2018but if it is all the same to you, I\u2019d rather have that one I was handling just now.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The other is a good three pound heavier,\u2019 said she, \u2018and we fattened it expressly for you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never mind. I\u2019ll have the other, and I\u2019ll take it now,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, just as you like,\u2019 said she, a little huffed. \u2018Which is it you want, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\u2019s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where are they all, Maggie?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Gone to the dealer\u2019s, Jem.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Which dealer\u2019s?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But was there another with a barred tail?\u2019 I asked, \u2018the same as the one I chose?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\u2014and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!\u201d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo more words. Get out!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, \u201cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.\u201d\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\r\n\r\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was early in April in the year \u201983 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut it\u2019s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then\u2014a fire?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-morning, madam,\u201d said Holmes cheerily. \u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,\u201d said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\u201d She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not fear,\u201d said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \u201cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know me, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,\u201d said he, smiling. \u201cThe left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\u201d said she. \u201cI started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\u2014none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\r\n\r\n\u201cFarintosh,\u201d said he. \u201cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas!\u201d replied our visitor, \u201cthe very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am all attention, madam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded his head. \u201cThe name is familiar to me,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother\u2019s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\u2014not less than \u00a3 1000 a year\u2014and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died\u2014she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather\u2019s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister is dead, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\u2019s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\u2019s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray be precise as to details,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\u2019s, the second my sister\u2019s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\u2019clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, Helen,\u2019 said she, \u2018have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Never,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not. But why?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\u2014perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\u2019 She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister\u2019s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister\u2019s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \u2018Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\u2019 There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor\u2019s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister\u2019s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d said Holmes, \u201care you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas your sister dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\u2019s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about poison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there are nearly always some there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\u2014a speckled band?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are very deep waters,\u201d said he; \u201cpray go on with your narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage\u2014Percy Armitage\u2014the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done wisely,\u201d said my friend. \u201cBut have you told me all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\u2019s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been cruelly used,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \u201cHe is a hard man,\u201d she said, \u201cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very deep business,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o\u2019clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.\u201d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDark enough and sinister enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter\u2019s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what, then, did the gipsies do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see many objections to any such theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich of you is Holmes?\u201d asked this apparition.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\u201d said my companion quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, Doctor,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cPray take a seat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,\u201d said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has she been saying to you?\u201d screamed the old man furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\u201d continued my companion imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You put me off, do you?\u201d said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. \u201cI know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the busybody!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis smile broadened.\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \u201cYour conversation is most entertaining,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go when I have had my say. Don\u2019t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\u201d He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\u201d he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems a very amiable person,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cI am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\u201d As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\r\n\r\n\u201cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\u2019 Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\u201d said he. \u201cTo determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife\u2019s death was little short of \u00a3 1,100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than \u00a3 750. Each daughter can claim an income of \u00a3 250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning\u2019s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley\u2019s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook there!\u201d said he.\r\n\r\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\r\n\r\n\u201cStoke Moran?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\u201d remarked the driver.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is some building going on there,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthat is where we are going.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the village,\u201d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; \u201cbut if you want to get to the house, you\u2019ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\u201d observed Holmes, shading his eyes. \u201cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought it as well,\u201d said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \u201cthat this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. \u201cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,\u201d she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \u201cAll has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctor\u2019s acquaintance,\u201d said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d she cried, \u201che has followed me, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it appears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\u2019s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister\u2019s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott\u2019s chamber?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \u201cHum!\u201d said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \u201cmy theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere does that bell communicate with?\u201d he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt goes to the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks newer than the other things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.\u201d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a dummy,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t it ring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery strange!\u201d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \u201cThere are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is also quite modern,\u201d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\u201d remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey seem to have been of a most interesting character\u2014dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d he asked, tapping the safe.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy stepfather\u2019s business papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! you have seen inside, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a cat in it, for example?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. What a strange idea!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, look at this!\u201d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; we don\u2019t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\u201d He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. That is quite settled,\u201d said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. \u201cHullo! Here is something interesting!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common enough lash. But I don\u2019t know why it should be tied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\u2019s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had never seen my friend\u2019s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall most certainly do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you that I am in your hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is the Crown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Your windows would be visible from there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, easily.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe rest you will leave in our hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what will you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\u201d said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\u2019s sleeve.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for pity\u2019s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\u2019s death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor\u2019s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, \u201cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I be of assistance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour presence might be invaluable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shall certainly come.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very kind of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw the ventilator, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott\u2019s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\u2019s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what harm can there be in that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot as yet see any connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say that I have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope\u2014or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness\u2019 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\u2019clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is our signal,\u201d said Holmes, springing to his feet; \u201cit comes from the middle window.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\r\n\r\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d I whispered; \u201cdid you see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a nice household,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat is the baboon.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes\u2019 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\r\n\r\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\r\n\r\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible\u2014a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see it, Watson?\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou see it?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can it mean?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt means that it is all over,\u201d Holmes answered. \u201cAnd perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe band! the speckled band!\u201d whispered Holmes.\r\n\r\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a swamp adder!\u201d cried Holmes; \u201cthe deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\u2019s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile\u2019s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\u2019s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had,\u201d said he, \u201ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word \u2018band,\u2019 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\u201d\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\u2019S THUMB\r\n\r\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice\u2014that of Mr. Hatherley\u2019s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\u2019s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of \u201989, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\u2019clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got him here,\u201d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \u201che\u2019s all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new patient,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI thought I\u2019d bring him round myself; then he couldn\u2019t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\u201d And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\r\n\r\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took it up and glanced at it. \u201cMr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\u201d That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. \u201cI regret that I have kept you waiting,\u201d said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \u201cYou are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,\u201d said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d I cried; \u201cpull yourself together!\u201d and I poured out some water from a caraffe.\r\n\r\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been making a fool of myself,\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Drink this.\u201d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried, \u201cthis is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! You should have been a surgeon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis has been done,\u201d said I, examining the wound, \u201cby a very heavy and sharp instrument.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA thing like a cleaver,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn accident, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! a murderous attack?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery murderous indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d I asked when I had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cCapital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d cried I, \u201cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I have heard of that fellow,\u201d answered my visitor, \u201cand I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do better. I\u2019ll take you round to him myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be immensely obliged to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.\u201d I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,\u201d said he. \u201cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said my patient, \u201cbut I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\u2019s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to \u00a3 27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of \u2018Colonel Lysander Stark\u2019 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Hatherley?\u2019 said he, with something of a German accent. \u2018You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. \u2018May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is quite correct,\u2019 I answered; \u2018but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential\u2014absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If I promise to keep a secret,\u2019 said I, \u2018you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you promise, then?\u2019 said he at last.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, I promise.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have already given you my word.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 said he, coming back. \u2018I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master\u2019s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.\u2019 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\r\n\r\n\u201cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I beg that you will state your business, sir,\u2019 said I; \u2018my time is of value.\u2019 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How would fifty guineas for a night\u2019s work suit you?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Most admirably.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I say a night\u2019s work, but an hour\u2019s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where to?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There is a drive, then?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said I, \u2018I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Entirely.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller\u2019s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I have heard so.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Some little time ago I bought a small place\u2014a very small place\u2014within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller\u2019s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left\u2014both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I quite follow you,\u2019 said I. \u2018The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller\u2019s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he carelessly, \u2018we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\u2019 He rose as he spoke. \u2018I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I shall certainly be there.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And not a word to a soul.\u2019 He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller\u2019s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\u2019clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne horse?\u201d interjected Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, only one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you observe the colour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTired-looking or fresh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, fresh and glossy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,\u2019 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. \u2018I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\u2019 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I would go,\u2019 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; \u2018I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But, madam,\u2019 said I, \u2018I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is not worth your while to wait,\u2019 she went on. \u2018You can pass through the door; no one hinders.\u2019 And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. \u2018For the love of Heaven!\u2019 she whispered, \u2018get away from here before it is too late!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is my secretary and manager,\u2019 said the colonel. \u2018By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018On the contrary,\u2019 said I, \u2018I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \u2018Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\u2019 said he. \u2018Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no, it is in the house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What, you dig fuller\u2019s-earth in the house?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\r\n\r\n\u201cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We are now,\u2019 said he, \u2018actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\u2019s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. \u2018I was admiring your fuller\u2019s-earth,\u2019 said I; \u2018I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall know all about the machine.\u2019 He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 I yelled. \u2018Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come! come!\u2019 she cried breathlessly. \u2018They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit\u2019s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is your only chance,\u2019 said she. \u2018It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\u2019s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Fritz! Fritz!\u2019 she cried in English, \u2018remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are mad, Elise!\u2019 he shouted, struggling to break away from her. \u2018You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\u2019 He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\u2019s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,\u201d said he. \u201cIt appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \u2018Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\u2019clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,\u2019 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried my patient. \u201cThen that explains what the girl said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said he. \u201cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was an hour\u2019s good drive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I cannot understand,\u201d said I, \u201cis why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman\u2019s entreaties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,\u201d said Bradstreet. \u201cWell, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I could lay my finger on it,\u201d said Holmes quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, now!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cyou have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I say east,\u201d said my patient.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am for west,\u201d remarked the plain-clothes man. \u201cThere are several quiet little villages up there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am for north,\u201d said I, \u201cbecause there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d cried the inspector, laughing; \u201cit\u2019s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are all wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t all be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, you can. This is my point.\u201d He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. \u201cThis is where we shall find them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the twelve-mile drive?\u201d gasped Hatherley.\r\n\r\n\u201cSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\u201d observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. \u201cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThey are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\r\n\r\n\u201cA house on fire?\u201d asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d said the station-master.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did it break out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Becher\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d broke in the engineer, \u201cis Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master laughed heartily. \u201cNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn\u2019t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \u201cThere is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, at least,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyou have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Holmes\u2019 fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\u2019 ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.\r\n\r\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, \u201cit has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExperience,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cIndirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\u201d\r\n\r\nX.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\r\n\r\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\u2019s noble correspondent could be.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\u201d I remarked as he entered. \u201cYour morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\u201d he answered, smiling, \u201cand the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot social, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, distinctly professional.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd from a noble client?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the highest in England.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like it,\u201d said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. \u201cI have had nothing else to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, with the deepest interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018ROBERT ST. SIMON.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,\u201d remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says four o\u2019clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\u201d He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. \u201cHere he is,\u201d said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. \u201c\u2018Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\u2019 Hum! \u2018Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.\u2019 He\u2019s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\u201d said I, \u201cfor the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now\u2014though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: \u2018A marriage has been arranged,\u2019 it says, \u2018and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\u2019 That is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerse and to the point,\u201d remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: \u2018There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god\u2019s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Holmes, yawning.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later\u2014that is, on Wednesday last\u2014there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater\u2019s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore the what?\u201d asked Holmes with a start.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe vanishing of the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did she vanish, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the wedding breakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn you that they are very incomplete.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps we may make them less so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \u2018Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\u2019:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\u2019s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now\u2014so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord Robert St. Simon,\u201d announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\u201d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \u201cPray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I am descending.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy last client of the sort was a king.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe King of Scandinavia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat! Had he lost his wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can understand,\u201d said Holmes suavely, \u201cthat I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! Very right! very right! I\u2019m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\u2014this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. \u201cYes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn San Francisco, a year ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were travelling in the States?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you become engaged then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you were on a friendly footing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer father is very rich?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did he make his money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, what is your own impression as to the young lady\u2019s\u2014your wife\u2019s character?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. \u201cYou see, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cmy wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous\u2014volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear\u201d\u2014he gave a little stately cough\u2014\u201chad I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you her photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI brought this with me.\u201d He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas she in good spirits?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was as bright as possible\u2014at least until after the ceremony.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray let us have it, for all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment\u2019s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\u2019s friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father\u2019s house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA confidential servant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not overhear what they said?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady St. Simon said something about \u2018jumping a claim.\u2019 She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn your arm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride\u2019s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\u2019s house that morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWe have been on a friendly footing for some years\u2014I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran\u2019s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid your wife hear all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\u2014I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success\u2014I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cAnd now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\u201d said our client, rising.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? What was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say that I have solved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere, then, is my wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon shook his head. \u201cI am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,\u201d he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \u201cI think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\u2019s example.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases\u2014but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, then?\u201d asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cYou look dissatisfied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally! You surprise me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\u201d said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Heaven\u2019s name, what for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy? What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \u201cI suppose you know all about it,\u201d he snarled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it very unlikely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?\u201d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride\u2019s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \u201cThere,\u201d said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \u201cThere is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \u201cYou dragged them from the Serpentine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\u2019s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you, indeed, now?\u201d cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \u201cI am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.\u201d He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. \u201cListen to this: \u2018You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.\u2019 Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Lestrade,\u201d said Holmes, laughing. \u201cYou really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.\u201d He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. \u201cThis is indeed important,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! you find it so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExtremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \u201cWhy,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at the wrong side!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe right side? You\u2019re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201c\u2018Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.\u2019 I see nothing in that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve wasted time enough,\u201d said Lestrade, rising. \u201cI believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.\u201d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\u201d drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; \u201cI will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.\u201d\r\n\r\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. \u201cThere is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,\u201d he remarked, \u201cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was after five o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\u2019s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\r\n\r\nJust before nine o\u2019clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have laid the supper, then,\u201d he said, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\u201d said he. \u201cI am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy messenger reached you, then?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will the Duke say,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhen he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you look on these things from another standpoint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a slight, sir, a public slight,\u201d said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I heard a ring,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.\u201d He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. \u201cLord St. Simon,\u201d said he \u201callow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re angry, Robert,\u201d said she. \u201cWell, I guess you have every cause to be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray make no apology to me,\u201d said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\u2019t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn\u2019t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I may give an opinion,\u201d remarked the strange gentleman, \u201cwe\u2019ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\u201d He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell our story right away,\u201d said the lady. \u201cFrank here and I met in \u201984, in McQuire\u2019s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn\u2019t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to \u2019Frisco. Frank wouldn\u2019t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we be married right away, then,\u2019 said he, \u2018and then I will feel sure of you; and I won\u2019t claim to be your husband until I come back?\u2019 Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners\u2019 camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\u2019s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \u2019Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \u2019Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\u2019d have done my duty by him. We can\u2019t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn\u2019t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn\u2019t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me\u2014seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also\u2014but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \u2019Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw it in a paper,\u201d explained the American. \u201cIt gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again\u2014just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t forgive me? You won\u2019t shake hands before I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\u201d He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had hoped,\u201d suggested Holmes, \u201cthat you would have joined us in a friendly supper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that there you ask a little too much,\u201d responded his Lordship. \u201cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\u201d He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe case has been an interesting one,\u201d remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, \u201cbecause it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon\u2019s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\u2019s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\u2014which in miners\u2019 parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to\u2014the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband\u2014the chances being in favour of the latter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how in the world did you find them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you deduce the select?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut with no very good result,\u201d I remarked. \u201cHis conduct was certainly not very gracious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \u201cperhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\u201d\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\r\n\r\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, \u201chere is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe is looking up at the numbers of the houses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that he is coming here,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\u201d As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\u201d said he. \u201cYou are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt you think me mad?\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see that you have had some great trouble,\u201d responded Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod knows I have!\u2014a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray compose yourself, sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cand let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d answered our visitor, \u201cis probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel that time is of value,\u201d said he; \u201cthat is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than\u2014well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth\u2014one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Holder,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The firm does so when the security is good.\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is absolutely essential to me,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I should have \u00a3 50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\u2019s self under obligations.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\u2019 said I, \u2018were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should much prefer to have it so,\u2019 said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \u2018You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Precisely.\u2019 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. \u2018There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\u2019 said he, \u2018and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You doubt its value?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Not at all. I only doubt\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ample.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \u00a3 1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\u2019 safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\u2014a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\u2019s quick insight into character.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house\u2014sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\u2014forever too late!\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where have you put it?\u2019 asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018In my own bureau.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, I hope to goodness the house won\u2019t be burgled during the night.\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is locked up,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look here, dad,\u2019 said he with his eyes cast down, \u2018can you let me have \u00a3 200?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I cannot!\u2019 I answered sharply. \u2018I have been far too generous with you in money matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have been very kind,\u2019 said he, \u2018but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And a very good thing, too!\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\u2019 said he. \u2018I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \u2018You shall not have a farthing from me,\u2019 I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure\u2014a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tell me, dad,\u2019 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \u2018did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite sure, dad.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-night.\u2019 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Arthur!\u2019 I screamed, \u2018you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You blackguard!\u2019 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \u2018You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Stolen!\u2019 he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, thief!\u2019 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You have called me names enough,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\u2019 I cried half-mad with grief and rage. \u2018I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You shall learn nothing from me,\u2019 said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. \u2018If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\u2019s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018At least,\u2019 said he, \u2018you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,\u2019 said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You may as well face the matter,\u2019 said I; \u2018you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\u2019 he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of \u00a3 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you receive much company?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur\u2019s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you go out much in society?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is unusual in a young girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerrible! She is even more affected than I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\u2019s guilt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was twisted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\u2019s closing his bedroom door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cis it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what other is there?\u201d cried the banker with a gesture of despair. \u201cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is our task to find that out,\u201d replied Holmes; \u201cso now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker\u2019s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\u2019 judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\r\n\r\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\u2019s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen\u2019s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\u2019s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\u2019s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\u2014never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman?\u201d she asked, facing round to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe stable lane?\u201d She raised her dark eyebrows. \u201cWhat can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,\u201d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. \u201cI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere they all fastened this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle\u2019s remarks about the coronet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\u201d cried the banker impatiently, \u201cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe stood,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cto the left of the door\u2014that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\u2019s expressive black eyes. \u201cWhy, you are like a magician,\u201d said she. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\u2019 thin, eager face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\u201d said he. \u201cI shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. \u201cNow we shall go upstairs,\u201d said he at last.\r\n\r\nThe banker\u2019s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich key was used to open it?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat which my son himself indicated\u2014that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you it here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is it on the dressing-table.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a noiseless lock,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.\u201d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\u2019s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Holmes, \u201chere is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker recoiled in horror. \u201cI should not dream of trying,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I will.\u201d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. \u201cI feel it give a little,\u201d said he; \u201cbut, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that I still share my uncle\u2019s perplexity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\u201d said he; \u201cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe banker wrung his hands. \u201cI shall never see them again!\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd my son? You give me hopes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy opinion is in no way altered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for God\u2019s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would give my fortune to have them back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\u2019s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that this should do,\u201d said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. \u201cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won\u2019t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\u201d He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\r\n\r\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\u201cI only looked in as I passed,\u201d said he. \u201cI am going right on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don\u2019t wait up for me in case I should be late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\r\n\r\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it is after nine now,\u201d I answered. \u201cI should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\u201d said he. \u201cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDeserted you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MY DEAREST UNCLE,\u2014I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018MARY.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would not think \u00a3 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would pay ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for \u00a3 4000.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cI am saved! I am saved!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOwe!\u201d He caught up a pen. \u201cName the sum, and I will pay it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy Mary? Impossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England\u2014a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\u201d cried the banker with an ashen face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants\u2019 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible?\u201d gasped the banker.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\u201d cried Mr. Holder. \u201cOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the house,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cI at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen\u2019s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret\u2014the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\u2019s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\u201d said Mr. Holder.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held\u2014\u00a3 1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. \u2018Why, dash it all!\u2019 said he, \u2018I\u2019ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\u2019 I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at \u00a3 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\u2019clock, after what I may call a really hard day\u2019s work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\u201d said the banker, rising. \u201cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that we may safely say,\u201d returned Holmes, \u201cthat she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.\u201d\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of The Daily Telegraph, \u201cit is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said I, smiling, \u201cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have erred, perhaps,\u201d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood\u2014\u201cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\u201d I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\u2019s singular character.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\u201d said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \u201cIf I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing\u2014a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \u201cyou can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end may have been so,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\u201d He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.\r\n\r\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MR. HOLMES,\u2014I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201cVIOLET HUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know the young lady?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot I.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is half-past ten now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\u2019s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\u201d said she, as my companion rose to greet her, \u201cbut I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been a governess for five years,\u201d said she, \u201cin the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\u2019s end as to what I should do.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway\u2019s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!\u2019 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are looking for a situation, miss?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018As governess?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And what salary do you ask?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I had \u00a3 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, tut, tut! sweating\u2014rank sweating!\u2019 he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \u2018How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\u2019 said I. \u2018A little French, a little German, music, and drawing\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Tut, tut!\u2019 he cried. \u2018This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at \u00a3 100 a year.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is also my custom,\u2019 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, \u2018to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018May I ask where you live, sir?\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One child\u2014one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!\u2019 He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\u2019s amusement, but the father\u2019s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My sole duties, then,\u2019 I asked, \u2018are to take charge of a single child?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to make myself useful.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know\u2014faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\u2019 said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am afraid that it is quite essential,\u2019 said he. \u2018It is a little fancy of my wife\u2019s, and ladies\u2019 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\u2019 fancies must be consulted. And so you won\u2019t cut your hair?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, sir, I really could not,\u2019 I answered firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\u2019 she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018If you please, Miss Stoper.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,\u2019 said she sharply. \u2018You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\u2019 She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting \u00a3 100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\r\n\u201c\u2018DEAR MISS HUNTER,\u2014Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give \u00a3 30 a quarter, or \u00a3 120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,\u201d said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a possible solution\u2014in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\u2014too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you \u00a3 120 a year, when they could have their pick for \u00a3 40? There must be some strong reason behind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDanger! What danger do you foresee?\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head gravely. \u201cIt would cease to be a danger if we could define it,\u201d said he. \u201cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is enough.\u201d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. \u201cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\u201d With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt least,\u201d said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, \u201cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she would need to be,\u201d said Holmes gravely. \u201cI am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before my friend\u2019s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \u201cData! data! data!\u201d he cried impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t make bricks without clay.\u201d And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\r\n\r\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\u201d said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\r\n\r\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\u201d it said. \u201cDo come! I am at my wit\u2019s end.\r\n\r\n\u201cHUNTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d asked Holmes, glancing up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should wish to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look it up, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a train at half-past nine,\u201d said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. \u201cIt is due at Winchester at 11:30.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\u2019s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\u201d I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\r\n\r\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cWho would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou horrify me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\u2019s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. She has her freedom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am so delighted that you have come,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cIt is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray tell us what has happened to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us have everything in its due order.\u201d Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can you not understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton\u2019s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father\u2019s young wife.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad of all details,\u201d remarked my friend, \u201cwhether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense r\u00e9pertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Jephro,\u2019 said she, \u2018there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\u2019 he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, I know no one in these parts.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Surely it would be better to take no notice.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray continue,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYour narrative promises to be a most interesting one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look in here!\u2019 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. \u2018Is he not a beauty?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be frightened,\u2019 said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. \u2018It\u2019s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\u2019s as much as your life is worth.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o\u2019clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI assured him that I was not offended. \u2018By the way,\u2019 said I, \u2018you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Photography is one of my hobbies,\u2019 said he. \u2018I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\u2019 He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty\u2014a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\u2019s instinct; perhaps it was woman\u2019s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran\u2014ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So,\u2019 said he, smiling, \u2018it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I am so frightened!\u2019 I panted.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\u2019\u2014you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was\u2014\u2018and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\u2019 I answered. \u2018But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Only that?\u2019 said he, looking at me keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why, what did you think?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why do you think that I lock this door?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure that I do not know.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\u2019 He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am sure if I had known\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again\u2019\u2014here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll throw you to the mastiff.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\u2019clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Toller still drunk?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the wine-cellar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will try. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\u2019clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will do it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers\u2014possibly her fianc\u00e9\u2014and no doubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\u2019t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child\u2019s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d cried our client. \u201cA thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o\u2019clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \u201cThat is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,\u201d said she. \u201cHer husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \u201cNow lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.\r\n\r\n\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthis beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\u2019s intentions and has carried his victim off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\u201d He swung himself up onto the roof. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he cried, \u201chere\u2019s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is impossible,\u201d said Miss Hunter; \u201cthe ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou villain!\u201d said he, \u201cwhere\u2019s your daughter?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is for me to ask you that,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\u2019ll serve you!\u201d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone for the dog!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have my revolver,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter close the front door,\u201d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he cried. \u201cSomeone has loosed the dog. It\u2019s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\u2019t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \u201cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand I\u2019d have done so before now if I could ha\u2019 got out from the cellar. If there\u2019s police-court business over this, you\u2019ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend\u2019s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\u2019s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\u2019s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\u2019t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Mrs. Toller serenely.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfor you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\u2019s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will be renamed.\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection.

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \u201cRight of Replacement or Refund\u201d described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
