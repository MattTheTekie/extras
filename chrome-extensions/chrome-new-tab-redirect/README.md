About:

Your own URL website will open in a New Tab.

You need to enter your website URL address in the addon options, then this address will be opened every time when you press the "+" button for create New Tab (or Ctrl+T)

For Install on Chrome, Edge and other chromium browser:
* Rename name.crx file to name.zip and unzip, it's if you not have a dir with extension
* Enable developer mode in Extensions menu
* Select "Load unpacked" and select dir with extension
* Done.


Notice:

How it works: when you open a new tab, the extension creates a new tab with your website address and closes the current one (redirect)
